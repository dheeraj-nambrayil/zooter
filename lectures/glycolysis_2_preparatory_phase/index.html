            hello everyone welcome back to the new
            session in biochemistry
            and here we will be continuing with the
            previous presentation that is a
            glycolytic pathway
            so uh glycolysis has already defined it
            is uh
            the sequence of reactions that will
            break down
            a single molecule of glucose to two
            molecules of pyruvic acid
            along with the production of atp
            molecules right
            and the glycolysis can be differentiated
            in two steps the first one being the
            preparatory phase or the priming phase
            or it is otherwise known as
            activation or energizing phase where the
            glucose is getting
            activated or energized to produce
            uh glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate okay so
            here what happens is
            glucose is getting phosphorylated uh
            and uh it is converted into a three
            carbon phosphorylated sugar
            okay the glucose is a six carbon sugar
            so six carbon glucose it is getting
            converted into three carbon
            phosphorylated sugar
            okay and here it is an energy uh
            investment phase where
            atp it is getting utilized at various
            steps
            for getting um for for getting uh
            phosphorylation process happen now the
            second phase it is a payoff phase that
            is energy generation phase it is
            actually
            where the glyceraldehyde three phosphate
            which is uh molecules two
            glycerol had two molecules of glyceralia
            three phosphates are produced
            and these molecules are getting
            converted into pyruvic acid through
            various tips
            and during this process this particular
            phase atp is generated and hence it is
            also referred as
            energy generation phase okay so
            glycolysis gets completed
            in two phases preparatory phase or it is
            otherwise known as priming phase priming
            means
            glucose is getting what you call
            prepared for
            or it is getting activated or it is
            getting phosphorylated for
            um getting into the glycolytic pathway
            okay
            so it is preparatory phase and this
            involves glucoconversion of
            six carbon glucose to the three carbon
            glyceraldehyde
            phosphate okay then here atp it is
            getting utilized
            at two steps right uh a single molecule
            of glucose is getting converted two
            molecules of glyceraldehyde three
            phosphate
            now in the next phase that is a payoff
            phase that is energy generation phase
            where ah each of the molecules
            of molecules of whatever glyceraldehyde
            3-phosphate it gets converted into three
            carbon
            pyruvic acid and during this atp
            molecules are produced at various stages
            atv molecules are produced
            okay uh now so we will see
            Preparatory Phase
            in detail what happens in each of the
            phases the first one is the preparatory
            phase
            preparatory phase as already mentioned
            it involves
            uh phosphorylation of glucose and its
            conversion to
            glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate okay glucose
            molecules how it reaches the cell
            so uh after like intake of food after
            its digestion in the elementary canal
            after its absorption at the intestine
            the blood glucose the glucose enters the
            blood and the blood glucose level
            increases
            the blood uh takes the glucose to
            various
            uh tissues and cells in need of the
            glucose molecule and then the glucose
            will enter the cell
            from the uh blood uh
            by actively or passively whatever it is
            because it is glucose is
            permeable to the cell membrane and uh
            maybe in some cases it may also require
            that uh
            help of certain transporters which we
            call as glute or glucose transporter
            molecules
            and whichever way it is glucose will
            enter the cell
            now glucose since it is uh it may be
            permeable to the cell membrane it may
            come
            get transported back to avoid such
            conditions glucose have to be fixed
            inside the
            cell and this is done with the help of
            phosphorylation process or we call it as
            a first
            priming reaction okay so glucose gets
            phosphorylated to produce the glucose
            6-phosphate
            glucose 6-phosphate it is impermeable to
            the cell membrane
            and we can see that this glucose
            6-phosphate it becomes
            a substrate in in various metabolic
            reactions for example like gluco
            like glycogenesis gluconeogenesis etc
            and it is a very important molecule okay
            coming back to the process
            the glucose it gets phosphorus related
            to glucose 6-phosphate
            with the utilization of atp molecule so
            uh the terminal phosphoryl
            group of atp is getting transferred to
            glucose for the production of glucose x
            phosphate
            the any enzyme which catalyzes the
            transfer of
            terminal phosphoryl group of atp onto a
            substrate
            we call them as kinases okay
            and here specifically we can see it is
            an exhaust sugar onto which the
            terminal phosphoryl group is getting
            transferred to and hence the enzyme is
            known as hexokinases
            okay now hexokinase if you see there are
            four types of exokinases hexokinase one
            two three and four uh given raman
            numbers one two three and four
            the hexokinases one two and three they
            are found in uh
            various cell types and they are
            they can phosphorylate um like glucose
            mannose fructose etc
            okay to its phosphorylated forms um
            now uh the hexokinase four
            uh they are found on the hepatocytes or
            the liver cells and the beta cells of
            the pancreas and these are responsible
            for
            uh the type four uh hexokinase that is
            specifically responsible for
            phosphorylation of alpha d glucose and
            hence type four hexokinase is also known
            as
            glucokinase and these four different
            types of hexokinases are being called as
            a isozymes
            uh i hope you remember the isozymes
            which we discussed in
            under enzymes the isozymes of these
            [Music]
            hexokinesis they are they
            actually catalyze similar reactions in
            various cells
            uh but what happens is structurally
            maybe
            they may be different that is chemical
            composition of the enzyme may be
            different
            uh then it is also one of one more thing
            regarding hexokinases is that
            they are gene products of different
            genes they are products of different
            genes
            okay so just because they take up
            similar reactions they catalyze similar
            reactions they have been named as
            exokinases
            right so it is one two three and four
            different types these four
            types are referred as the isozymes of
            hexokinesis
            now coming back to the glycolytic
            Glycolysis Pathway
            pathway the glucose we can see that it
            is getting
            phosphorylated to form glucose 6
            phosphate and this reaction is
            ah irreversible process that is the same
            enzyme cannot bring about the
            reversible reaction ah getting the
            glucose back from glucose
            phosphate cannot happen with the help of
            hexokinase okay so it is a irreversible
            process
            another thing is like or just like many
            other kinases we can see hexokinase
            require
            magnesium ion the presence of magnesium
            ions as a cofactor
            okay now the next reaction is the
            isomerization process so the first
            priming reaction of foster
            phosphorylation reaction it is glucose
            to glucose 6 phosphate
            and i hope you understood why the name
            has come hexokinases
            the kinases wherever phosphorylation
            happens with the help of atp
            the enzyme involved will be a kinase
            okay now the next is isomerization
            process where
            uh glucose is getting converted to
            fructose
            i hope you remember glucose is a aldo
            hexose and fructose is a
            keto hexose right so it is getting
            converted
            and this is actually an isomerization
            process and you can see
            glucose 6 phosphate it get isomerized to
            the fructose
            phosphate and this particular process
            uh it has been it is a uh you can see a
            reversible process
            and the enzyme involved as phospho
            hexose isomerase
            the isomerization process and hence the
            enzyme is isomerase
            and since the isomerization takes place
            between
            phosphorylated hexose sugars because the
            enzyme has got the name phospho hexose
            isomerase
            okay i hope you will remember how the ah
            name has come
            the enzyme okay now next one as you can
            see here this is a fructose phosphate
            right so uh uh glucose six phosphate uh
            where the sixth carbon is having the
            phosphoryl phosphoryl group while the ah
            in the fructose phosphate the sixth
            carbon is having the phosphoryl group
            over here
            right now what happens next is again the
            second priming reaction or second
            phosphorylation reaction
            where fructose phosphate is getting
            phosphor related to fructose 1 6
            phosphate
            okay this is bisphosphate we'll see why
            the name has come
            now here what happens is uh apart from
            this phosphoryl group on the sixth
            carbon the fructose phosphate also gets
            phosphorylated on the one first
            carbon right so you have the first and
            the sixth
            carbon being phosphorylated now since
            the two phosphates are on two different
            carbons
            the name has come bisphosphate if the
            two phosphoryl group were on the same
            carbon one after the other
            the name would have come diphosphate i
            hope you remember adenine diphosphate
            right
            it was because the two phosphates were
            added on the same carbon one after the
            other
            but here it is two phosphates are uh
            added but on two different carbons and
            hence the name
            fructose one six phosphate okay
            so for uh the enzyme is
            phosphofructokinase
            why the name kinase because it is
            phosphorylation with the help of atp
            now why the phosphor fractal because it
            is uh phosphorylated fructose it is
            getting
            uh phosphorylated again so that is why
            the name phosphofructokinase okay
            so for uh the second priming reaction
            involves the phosphorylation of
            phosphorus sorry what you call fructose
            6 phosphate
            ah to fructose 1 6 bisphosphate and this
            is a
            again you can see it is an irreversible
            process and this
            requires atp and uh uh the enzyme
            involved is
            uh phosphofructokinase one fine i hope
            that part is clear
            now the next step we have is the con uh
            conversion of fructose one six
            bisphosphate again this is also a six
            carbon sugar till here they are
            six carbon sugars okay coming over here
            what happens
            this involves splitting phase okay or
            the step which involves the splitting of
            fructose one six by
            this phosphate here the cleavage of six
            carbon
            sugar phosphate sugar phosphate to two
            three carbon sugar phosphate so what has
            happened the
            uh the fructose 1 6 bisphosphates that
            is being cleaved to
            produce two three carbon sugars
            phosphorylated sugars
            okay and these are glyceraldehyde three
            phosphate and dihydroxy acetone
            phosphate
            right so uh you can see here the uh
            what you call the fructose 1 6
            bisphosphate it is getting
            split or cleaved
            to produce two different trios
            phosphates and they are glyceraldehyde 3
            phosphate
            and dihydroxy acetone phosphate okay and
            this particular reaction is again
            um a reversible process and it has been
            catalyzed by the enzyme
            aldolase okay uh you can see here this
            is
            um aldo's sugar right aldi had
            containing sugar and this is a keto
            sugar
            again this can be isomerized these two
            can be
            isomerized ah and
            that is dihydroxy acetone phosphate can
            get isomerized to produce glyceraldehyde
            3 phosphate
            okay so and this is uh done with the
            help of
            the triose phosphate isomerase okay
            uh that is um interconversion of the two
            triose phosphates happen
            uh only one of the two trios phosphates
            formed
            by the elderly's enzyme can be directly
            degraded
            in the uh coming steps subsequent steps
            of glycolysis that is
            to uh uh one of only one of the uh
            trios phosphates will enter the payoff
            phase okay
            so before that what happens is these two
            get uh
            interconverted usually glyceraldehyde
            three phosphate is the sugar which will
            enter the
            payoff so dihydroxy acetone phosphate it
            will get isomerized to produce the
            glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate
            with the help of trios phosphate
            isomerase here it is isomerization
            process taking place as already
            mentioned
            these two are trioses that is three
            carbon sugars
            okay this is an aldolase sorry what you
            call aldos
            and this is a ketos okay it is getting
            interconverted so isomerization process
            which will be catalyzed by isomerase
            enzyme okay
            so what kind of uh sugars are getting
            isomerized here
            it is a trio sugar and it is
            phosphorylated hence the name
            trios phosphate isomerase i hope that
            part is clear
            okay so only glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate
            Conclusion
            will enter the payoff phase
            okay so all the sugars which are
            produced different types of sugars which
            are produced from
            fructose 1 6 by phosphate through the
            cleaving
            it will get converted into
            glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate right
            so only glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate will
            enter the payoff phase
            and in the pair phase what is happening
            it is oxidative conversion of
            glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate
            to produce the pyruvic acid and this is
            actually
            the whole set of reactions in pair phase
            is in
            involves the production of atp molecules
            at various stages okay
            and the payoff phase will be described
            in the next presentation
            fine thank you
