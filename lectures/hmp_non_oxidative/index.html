            hello everyone welcome back we'll
            continue with the presentation
            on uh the next metabolic pathway to
            exercise
            um the hexose monophosphate pathway are
            the pentose phosphate fabric it occurs
            in
            two phases the first is oxidative phase
            and the second is
            non-oxidative phase in the oxidative
            phase the glucose
            phosphate it gets converted into the
            ribose fight phosphate and sinus
            biphosphate
            here actually what is happening a hexose
            phosphorylated hexose that is getting
            converted to phosphorylated pentoses
            okay and during this reaction the carbon
            dioxide molecule is
            uh released as well as two molecules of
            nadph
            are produced and that is why this one is
            an oxidative phase okay
            in the second phase that is
            non-oxidative phase which we are going
            to explain in this particular slide
            here nadph are not getting produced but
            instead
            we have uh intermediary products of
            glycolytic pathway being produced okay
            the first
            reaction over here is trans keto based
            reaction before we go into the first
            reaction we can see that
            the non uh sorry whatever in the
            oxidative phase
            of the pentose phosphate pathway is
            resulted in the production
            of ribose 5-phosphate and cylos
            5-phosphate
            through isomerization and epimerization
            from the ribulose 5-phosphate
            respectively and during this process
            actually one molecule of fibos one
            molecular side this five phosphate are
            produced right
            but for the non-oxidative phase of the
            hmp to
            continue one molecule of ribose phi
            phosphate and two molecules of cytolous
            5-phosphate are to be
            required i hope it is clear for the hmp
            to be continued then especially the
            non-oxidative pathway to be
            non-oxidative phase of the hmb pathway
            to continue
            one molecule of ribose 5 phosphate and
            two molecules of cylinders 5-phosphate
            has to be present is to be
            are required okay now what happens that
            is the first step here
            is the uh trans ketolies reaction during
            which
            the pentose phosphates are converted
            into
            a heptos and a trios okay now
            what happens here there is a uh trans
            of two carbon glycol aldehyde is getting
            transferred from
            silos five phosphate to ribose phosphate
            when a two carbon is taken out from the
            cellulose phosphate
            sinus phosphate is a five carbon sugar
            right so when two carbon
            compound is taken it becomes three
            carbon compound isn't it so cyanology
            on removal of glycol aldehyde a two
            carbon compound
            it becomes three carbon sugar okay on
            the other hand
            when glycoaldehyde is uh received by the
            ribose fine phosphate which is again a
            five carbon sugar
            it becomes a seven carbon sugar okay so
            this is what happens
            so here it results in the formation of
            that is a transfer of
            two carbon glycol aldehyde from
            cellulose biphosphate
            onto ribose phi phosphate will result in
            the formation of uh
            seven carbon sugar that is pseudo
            heptalose
            seven phosphate and a three carbon sugar
            glyceraldehyde three phosphate
            acidoheptolo7 phosphate is a
            phosphorylated
            ketose it is a ketosis
            and containing a seven carbon seven
            carbon
            okay and this is a aldo triose that is a
            triose with antibiotic
            okay now the whole reaction is catalyzed
            by trans ketolies
            this trans ketola is enzyme it require
            the presence of thyamine pyrophosphate
            that tpp
            and also magnesium ion for its activity
            okay
            now the next one is trans aldolase
            reaction
            okay so during here what happens is
            uh a three carbon dihydroxy acetone
            phosphate okay
            not phosphate i'm sorry three hydro
            dihydroxy acetone
            uh three carbon dihydroxy acetone is
            removed from
            pseudo heptulo7 phosphate and is
            transferred on to
            glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate okay so when
            a 3 carbon
            compound is taken from a 7 carbon
            it becomes four carbon compound while
            glyceraldehyde three phosphate which is
            already a triose when it receives a
            three carbon dihydroxy acetone
            it becomes a six carbon sugar okay so
            what happens is
            pseudo three carbon dihydroxy
            uh compound is transferred from
            pseudoheptalo7 phosphate onto
            glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate
            and results in the formation of
            uh like erythros for phosphate and
            fructose
            6-phosphate okay it is pseudo-reptile
            seven phosphate which becomes erythrosis
            for phosphate
            and glyceraldehyde three phosphate it
            becomes structure six phosphate
            the whole reaction is catalyzed by the
            enzyme trans aldolase
            okay so the fructose phosphate it can
            either enter a glycolytic pathway
            or it can isomerize to produce glucose 6
            phosphate
            and this glucose 6 phosphate can
            re-enter the pentose phosphate pathway
            to the oxidative base okay glucose
            phosphate it can be a substrate for the
            pentose
            oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate
            pathway
            okay now what happens to erythrosis for
            phosphate
            the erythros for phosphate it can
            continue with the
            reaction you remember uh two molecules
            of cyber lose five phosphate and one
            molecule of fibrophosphate
            was where required for the non-oxidative
            phase one molecule of ribose biphosphate
            is already used up over here
            and one molecule of side loose fibers it
            is also used
            one more molecule is pending and that
            has been used over here
            okay so here that is the next or the
            second trans-ketolies
            reaction where ah you can see these two
            are the molecules
            which come into play that is erythro's
            four phosphates which are produced
            through transcendentalist reaction
            and the second cylorosiphosphate
            molecule
            okay here two carbon glycol aldehyde
            it gets transferred from cyrus 5
            phosphate on
            to erythro's 4 phosphate okay so 2
            carbon aldol molecule glycol aldehyde
            when it is removed 2 carbon
            is removed from the 5 carbon cylinders
            it becomes glyceraldehyde
            phosphate okay and when the
            two uh carbon glycol aldehyde is
            received by the erythrosphere phosphate
            it will become focused to six carbon
            sugar fructose phosphate
            okay so a two carbon glycol aldehyde
            group was transferred from
            silos five phosphate on to erythros four
            phosphate
            which results in the formation of
            glyceraldehyde three phosphate and
            fructose
            phosphate and the whole uh reaction is
            catalyzed by
            transketolase enzyme okay now this is a
            hexose and this is one is a
            triose both these are intermediary
            substrates in the case of glycolysis i
            hope you remember
            these two may enter the glycolytic
            pathway or what happens is
            the glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate it can
            produce fructose 6 phosphate and this
            fructose 6 phosphate on the other hand
            can get isomerized to glucose
            phosphate and then enter the oxidative
            phase of the pentose phosphate pathway
            okay so here usually the glucose
            phosphate molecule
            six glucose six phosphate molecules are
            required
            for one complete uh pentose phosphate
            pathway
            and out of these six glucose six
            phosphate molecules
            five are regenerated in this way in the
            non-oxidative phase
            okay while one it gets one glucose six
            phosphate it gets oxidized to carbon
            dioxide and
            water so the complete oxidation of
            one molecule of glucose phosphate in a
            pentose phosphate pathway
            will result in the formation of six
            molecules of carbon dioxide
            12 molecules of nadph and
            h plus okay and one molecule of pi so
            this is how the whole reaction
            is completed i hope this part is clear
            so here you can see a summary of the
            whole thing
            oxidative phase glucose six phosphate to
            six phosphor gluconate to
            below five phosphate the glucose fiber
            spit will give rise to triple five
            phosphate and cytosine phosphate
            okay this will enter the uh
            non-oxidative phase okay
            uh through trans-ketosis and trans
            aldolase it may give back
            the glucose phosphate and re-entering
            the oxidative is once again
            okay and the ribose fibrosphere it can
            also become the
            uh substrate for the synthesis of
            nucleotide nucleic acid
            coenzymes etc during this particular so
            what are the byproducts that is
            the byproducts are ribose 5 phosphate
            nh2 nadph molecules
            these nadph molecules it can be used for
            uh the enzyme synthesis
            right which involves glutathione
            reductases
            it can also take part in reductive
            biosynthesis of fatty acids glycerols
            etcetera from their previous molecules
            so this is all about the hexose bone or
            phosphate okay
            fine thank you
