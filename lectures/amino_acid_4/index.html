            hello everyone welcome back to the
            session in metabolism
            we'll be continuing with the oxidation
            of amino acids
            and in the previous uh presentations we
            looked into
            the oxidation of amino acids through the
            conversion of amino group that is alpha
            amino group of
            amino acid okay in this presentation
            we'll be looking into
            the other two uh like ways or methods by
            which the amino acids get
            oxidized or degraded uh the second one
            on the row it is degradation of carbon
            framework of amino acids
            so during um amino acid catabolism
            or the degradation the hydrocarbon part
            of the amino acid it gets broken down
            and ultimately it get converted to
            products
            that get into the krebs cycle
            okay so we can see what are the various
            amino acids and what are the products
            produced during the degradation of
            carbon framework of the
            specific amino acid okay here you can
            see the first one
            the isoleucine leucine lysine tryptophan
            it ultimately gets converted to acetyl
            coenzyme and then
            it will enter the krebs cycle okay now
            the second one here we can see
            glutamine the glutamate histidine or
            nitin
            prolan arginine these amino acids it
            will get converted to
            alpha ketoglutaric acid while methionine
            threonine isoleucine and valine
            it will get converted finally to
            succinal coenzyme a
            through methylmelonyl coenzyme
            and then we have as a phenylalanine and
            tyrosine
            getting converted to fumarate
            or even we can see them being converted
            to acetyl coenzyme
            okay then aspartame and aspartate being
            converted to
            oxaloacetate then glycine serine
            cysteine alanine and tofan getting
            converted to pyruvate
            which will undergo oxidative
            decarboxylation later to produce acetyl
            coenzyme
            okay so these are all these are
            one in one way or the other being um
            part of the krebs cycle so finally it
            will enter the
            krebs cycle now we can see which are the
            major products here it is acetyl
            coenzyme
            alpha ketoglutarate succinal coenzyme
            fumarate and oxaloacetate so these are
            the
            five major products produced during the
            degradation of carbon framework of the
            different kinds of amino acids okay
            next is decarboxylation of amino acids
            now
            the carboxylation as the name suggests
            it is the removal of carbon dioxide
            uh from the amino acid with the
            formation of corresponding biological
            amines
            okay so it is the enzymatic removal of
            carboxyl group
            the cooh part alpha carboxyl group as
            carbon dioxide
            and this is very important in the
            production of biological amines from
            amino acids okay amines are produced
            biologically produced biological amines
            okay
            the enzymes which are involved it is
            decarboxylases
            you can see here and this require the co
            enzyme
            uh again periodoxyl phosphate okay
            so decarboxylation of amino acids it
            results in the formation of
            corresponding
            biogenic amines for example the
            carboxylation of histidine
            it will result in the formation of
            histamine and the carboxylation of
            tyrosine
            it will result in the formation of
            tyramine okay so here you can see what
            happens
            so this is the alpha amino acid and the
            alpha carboxyl group
            from there carbon dioxide is uh released
            okay so what happens
            co2 is getting released here so it
            becomes ch2 here
            okay so you have our ch2 nh2 which is an
            amine
            right so this is a this table it shows
            the biological amines produced from
            various uh
            what you call amino acids okay so
            we can see here that the decarboxylation
            um
            for example uh the history into
            histamine
            it requires the enzyme histidine
            decarboxylase
            okay and decarboxylation of like uh
            glutamic acid
            glue by glutamate decarboxylase so all
            these are very specific amino acids okay
            so we can see here the serine
            it will give rise to ethanol amine on
            the carboxylation
            which is uh used for uh forming the
            choline
            okay i hope you remember the when we
            studied about the lipids
            it is a part of the um lipid uh
            biochemistry isn't it colin is being
            calling as well as the ethanol amine it
            is being used for the
            synthesis of various kinds of lipids now
            glutamate it gets converted to gamma
            amino butyric acid
            or we commonly refer as gaba which is an
            inhibitory neurotransmitter
            histidine on the carboxylation by
            history in the carboxylase produces
            histamine
            histamine is a vasodilator and it
            promotes gastric hcl and pepsin
            synthesis
            okay phenylalanine it gets converted
            dopamine dopamine is again
            involved as metabolic precursor for the
            epinephrine and norepinephrine
            then tyrosine it gets converted tyramine
            which is a
            vasoconstrictor so it actually what
            happens
            was a cancer constrictor it actually
            increases the
            blood pressure isn't it so tryptophan it
            gets converted to
            tryptamine serotonin and melatonin
            uh the serotonin melatonin they are
            involved in circadian rhythms also
            it stimulates cerebral activity then
            we can see that the blood pressure is
            elevated by the
            bioamines produced from tryptophan okay
            then cysteine it gets converted to
            taurine uh taurine it is a constant of
            the bile acid
            uh when you study the um
            what you call the physiological aspect
            of the
            liver you can see that it secretes bind
            okay bile
            bile pigments and bile salts are there
            among that tauren is a very important
            constituent in the formation of
            the bile okay so this is about the um
            what you call the carboxylation we also
            saw the degradation of
            the carbon uh main part root the
            framework of amino acids what happens
            and what happens when the amino acids it
            undergoes decarboxylation
            it produces bio biogenic amines and we
            also saw the importance of
            biogenic amines in the biological system
            okay
            so that's about the uh the what you call
            the complete metabolism of amino acids
            uh the metabolism of amino acids we can
            like
            study under three categories that is one
            is the oxidation of
            amino group or sorry what you call a
            conversion of amino group
            then the degradation of the carbon
            framework
            and then the decarboxylation the
            conversion of alpha amino group it
            involves deamination
            uh like transamination transdeamination
            uh deamination we studied it under
            oxidative determination and
            non-oxidative deamination
            then we have is the uh what you call
            transamination we saw that it is a
            reversible transfer
            amino group from one amino acid to a
            keto acid
            which results in the formation of a new
            keto acid and an
            amino acid right and the being catalyzed
            by amino transferences
            then we also mentioned the trans
            deamination
            trans deamination it is oxidative
            deamination
            coupled with transamination process okay
            then we have
            the uh decarboxylation
            which we study in this presentation so
            this is with this we will be completing
            concluding the um metabolism of proteins
            oxidation of amino acids okay
            fine thank you
