            hello everyone welcome to a new session
            on metabolism
            in this uh session we will be dealing
            with the metabolism of
            proteins actually metabolism of proteins
            it is nothing but the metabolism of
            amino acids itself and that is why the
            heading has been given as
            uh the amino acid balancer here what
            happens is the dietary protein that is a
            protein which is
            uh which reaches the body through diet
            or even the protein in the body
            those get uh like high um
            undergoes proteolysis um by way of
            digestion in the gastrointestinal tract
            and produces the respective
            amino acids and these amino acids it may
            be taken through blood
            uh to various parts of the body
            especially in liver
            various oxidation of amino acids takes
            place like
            by the way of transamination deamination
            or decarboxylation
            we can see that the amino acids it can
            be converted into
            nitrogenous derivatives or narratives
            compounds
            by way of various other processes now
            what we are going to deal in this
            presentation is more about the oxidation
            methods uh the transamination
            deamination
            and the what you call uh
            decarboxylation methods okay it is
            catabolic uh
            degradation of amino acids we are more
            concerned with okay
            now how the oxidation of amino acids uh
            are classified
            it is actually for convenience of
            understanding the oxidation of amino
            acids or what we can say the catabolic
            degradation of amino acids can be con
            classified into three categories
            the conversion of alpha amino group
            breakdown and conversion of carbon
            framework
            decarboxylation of alpha carboxyl group
            simple thing alpha amino group is the
            amino group which is directly attached
            to the alpha carpet
            okay i hope you remember there is a
            central there is a carbon uh
            to which asymmetric carbon uh
            to which four different groups are
            attached directly in the case of amino
            acids that is
            amino group carboxyl group a hydrogen
            and a side chain and it is the side
            chain which
            decides the nature of the amino acids
            right
            the physical chemical properties of
            amino acid is desired by the side chain
            now the um amino group which is directly
            attached to the alpha carbon is what is
            referred as the alpha amino group
            and the carboxyl group directly attached
            to the uh alpha carbon it is alpha
            carboxyl group
            so these two undergo changes con
            and that is what hap happens in the
            oxidation of
            amino acids so oxidation of amino acids
            it can be divided into conversion of
            amino group the alpha amino group
            specifically
            it could be of three kinds or it could
            be done by three methods we can see
            uh here you can see deamination
            transamination and trans
            deamination so what is actually
            conversion of alpha amino group
            the alpha amino group of the amino acid
            it gets converted
            into ammonia okay and this ammonia in
            the case of deamination and trans
            deamination
            this uh con amino group it gets
            converted into ammonia and the free
            ammonia it is liberated
            while in the case of transamination this
            liberation doesn't take place so the
            the transamination does not involve uh
            what you call the release of uh ammonia
            okay it is this transfer of
            amino group from one to the other amino
            acid okay
            now degradation of carbon framework
            whatever is remaining like
            the even the the carbon framework in the
            r group the side chain it undergoes
            degradation okay
            and it it happens when it enters the
            citric acid cycle
            okay so that is what happens in the
            degradation uh or breakdown and
            conversion of the carbon framework
            okay the third one is the carboxylation
            that is as already mentioned the alpha
            carboxyl group
            uh undergoes decarboxylation right and
            uh like uh this is also a very important
            uh oxidative methods okay we will see in
            detail
            now uh conversion of amino group that is
            the first one
            right alpha amino group and here it
            involves the
            cleavage of amino group of alpha amino
            group
            from the amino acid as ammonium
            and it is uh it takes place in
            three reactions through three reactions
            uh or we can say there are three types
            of reactions which involve the
            conversion of
            amino group deamination transamination
            and tree trans deamination okay what is
            deamination
            deamination is nothing but deamination
            is removal of amino group
            from the amino acids as free ammonia
            okay and this results in the liberation
            of ammonia which is used for urea
            synthesis and
            we can say that the carbon skeleton of
            amino acids which are produced
            as a result of uh vertical removal after
            the removal of ammonia whatever the
            carbon skeleton of amino acid is there
            it gets converted into keto acid okay so
            we can see
            that the amino acid it undergo
            deamination
            and the output is release of free
            ammonia
            plus the formation of corresponding keto
            acid
            or we can say hydroxy acids okay
            uh in a vertebrae it's a major site of
            deamination
            ism liver mitochondria okay and there
            are four major
            even in some cases uh you can say some
            uh
            may take the kidney becomes the site for
            deamination therefore there are four
            major types of
            deamination oxidative reductive
            hydrolytic and
            intramolecular uh oxidative as the name
            suggests
            there is uh oxidation redox reaction
            taking place
            okay reductive removal of hydrogen
            hydrolytic
            involves the water molecule
            and intramolecular deamination that is
            we can see here
            it is within the molecule it's of the
            amino acid itself there is no
            addition or uh what you call uh this one
            of
            it is removal of ammonia and whatever
            pending whatever is remaining the carbon
            skeleton it undergoes intra molecular
            uh what you call shift and produces a
            new
            molecule okay we will see it in detail
            here and the in detail we will study the
            oxidative and hydrolytic hydrolytic uh
            deamination is also referred as
            non-oxidative so these are the two ones
            which we are going to do
            study in detail that is oxidative and
            the hydrolytic
            okay but we will see the other three i
            mean uh
            in general what are these reduction uh
            reduction and deamination or reductive
            deamination
            you can see this is the amino acid this
            is the alpha carbon
            this one is the uh alpha amino group
            alpha carboxyl group the hydrogen
            attached to the
            uh the alpha carbon and the side chain
            okay so in reductive denomination what
            is going to happen
            reduction means adhesion of hydrogen
            right so the
            hydrogen ions are added and what results
            it's
            this fatty acid okay so amino acid it
            gets converted to fatty acid with the
            liberation of ammonia in the reductive
            deamination okay the corresponding fatty
            acid
            i hope it is clear right hydrolytic
            deamination involves addition of water
            so this is the uh amino acid then we
            have
            water is added uh what is produced a
            hydroxy acid
            okay hydroxy acid is produced and
            ammonia is liberated
            okay in all the deamination process
            ammonia is liberated free ammonia is
            liberated okay
            so hydraulic deamination involves
            adhesion of water and
            conversion of amino acid to hydroxy acid
            with
            release of ammonia molecule
            intramolecular deamination
            here again amino acid here okay so
            ammonia is released
            like when ammonia is released what
            happens is
            it is nh3 right so here what happens is
            there is a double bond formed okay it is
            ch double bond sketch
            so it becomes unsaturated it is a fatty
            acid because it is having a coh group at
            the end
            and it is unsaturated because there is a
            double bond over here ch double bond ch
            okay so in the intramolecular
            deamination an amino acid it will result
            in the formation of unsaturated fatty
            acid on the removal of
            free ammonia so in all the deamination
            ammonia is the product and it is
            released
            and you can see what are the products
            produced other than ammonia it is uh
            apart from ammonia we can see fatty acid
            the hydroxy acid
            and the unsaturated uh fatty acid in the
            intra molecule deamination
            when we speak about oxidative
            deamination uh
            oxidative deamination it involves the
            use of nad plus as already mentioned it
            is a
            oxidation right so here nad plus is the
            oxidizing agent and alpha amino group or
            sorry vertical amino acid it gets
            converted to
            keto acid with the reduction of
            nad plus to nadh okay and
            ammonia is released okay so it is alpha
            amino acid it will get convert to keto
            acid
            and during this time nad it gets
            converted to
            nadh and ammonia it is being
            liberated okay so this uh this is just a
            general idea about deamination we'll be
            looking into oxidative deamination and
            hydraulic deamination
            in detail in the coming presentations
            thank you
