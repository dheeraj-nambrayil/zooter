            hello everyone welcome back to the
            sessions on the
            glycolysis and biochemistry so in the
            previous presentations we saw the detail
            of glycolytic reactions
            where the glucose it was broken down to
            form two molecules of pyruvate the
            glucose went through the preparatory
            phase to produce two molecules of
            glyceraldehyde three phosphate
            and each of the glyceraldehyde three
            phosphate molecules it uh
            underwent the uh what you call the
            payoff phase to produce
            uh two molecules of pyruvate and during
            this um
            whole process uh we can see that two
            molecules of atp
            here you can see we produced was used
            in the preparatory phase course was
            broken down to
            two molecules of crystalline three
            phosphate each of the glyceraldehyde
            three phosphate it went through the
            payoff phase to produce
            two molecules of pyruvate and during
            this payoff phase
            each of the glycerol three 3-phosphate
            resulted in
            the production of one nadh
            and two atp molecules okay so during the
            production of two
            pyruvate molecules two atp was used
            two nadh molecules were produced four
            atp molecules were produced
            and two water molecules were released so
            this is the whole
            complete reaction what happened in the
            uh glycolytic pathway
            so balancing the whole equation we get
            glucose plus two nad plus plus two atp
            plus two inorganic phosphate giving
            resulting in the formation of two
            pyruvate molecules
            two molecules of nadh and h plus and two
            molecules of atp
            with release of two molecules of water
            okay so this is the overall
            equation now when you look into how many
            atp molecules are produced like
            uh how many atp molecules are produced
            as a result of a single glycolytic
            pathway
            uh we can see here two atp molecules are
            already produced
            then one nadh is equivalent to
            uh three atp molecules okay almost
            three atp molecules so what happens is
            two nadh
            is equivalent to two into three six atp
            molecules
            so altogether we can see in when
            a single glucose molecule is getting
            broken down to two molecules of pyruvate
            in a glycolytic pathway
            almost like eight atp molecules are
            being produced so a net result it is
            eight atp molecules
            in uh like a glycolytic
            uh process okay so it is eight mole
            eight uh atp molecules are synthesized
            in glycolysis in
            aerobic condition okay now coming to the
            uh the phase of uh pyruvate okay
            pyruvate is getting converted to
            different products based upon in which
            condition they are the cell doesn't
            okay the glucose it undergoes the
            glycolytic 10 successive reactions of
            glycolysis to produce
            two pyruvate molecules the pyruvate
            molecule on the other hand
            uh when it is an anaerobic condition it
            can
            undergo two different kinds of reactions
            in
            east we can say sorry we can
            see that in uh what you call yeast and
            in some bacteria like zymomonas the
            pyruvate it undergoes uh alcoholic
            fermentation okay
            so alcoholic fermentation is anaerobic
            degradation of
            glucose to ethanol okay glucose
            by glycolytic pathway producing pyruvate
            pyruvate to ethanol so that is the whole
            process is known as a
            alcoholic fermentation where it is an
            anaerobic breakdown or anaerobic
            degradation of glucose to form
            the ethanol and here you can see ah
            that along with that carbon dioxide is
            also being produced
            so under anaerobic conditions or hypoxic
            conditions in yeast and in certain
            bacteria you can see
            the alcoholic fermentation taking place
            on the other hand
            in erythrocytes in
            skeletal muscles which are undergoing uh
            rigorous activities
            or in certain bacteria like
            lactobacillus streptococcus
            etc you can see that uh there is yet
            another
            uh like um uh pathway being undergone
            that is the
            lactic acid fermentation the lactic acid
            fermentation or the lactate fermentation
            is the anaerobic degradation of glucose
            to form
            lactic acid okay so these two pathways
            will be looking indeed in the coming
            slide
            then we have is in the aerobic condition
            what happens
            in aerobic condition the pyruvate it
            undergoes
            decarboxylation to produce acetyl
            coenzyme
            and the acetyl coenzyme will enter the
            citric acid cycle or
            the krebs cycle to produce carbon
            dioxide water
            and a good amount of atp during the
            process so this happens in
            during the aerobic uh condition okay so
            this is yet another
            cycle they where glucose is getting
            completely broken down to carbon dioxide
            water with the release of good amount of
            atp molecules
            so this is referred as the kreb cycle
            which we will be looking in detail in
            coming presentations okay the next one
            we have is the fermentation
            okay these two process it is known as a
            fermentation that is anaerobic
            respiration is what is referred as a
            fermentation right here the first one is
            the ethanol fermentation
            that is the uh degradation of glucose
            to ethanol through pyruvate okay
            so glucose to pyruvate we have already
            seen under glycolytic pathway
            now this is pyruvate the first step in
            the
            ethanol fermentation is the pyruvate
            getting converted into acetaldehyde
            it is a decarboxylation process so
            carbon dioxide molecule is released
            and the process is being this particular
            reaction is being catalyzed by
            pyruvate decarboxylase i hope you
            can get how the name has come the enzyme
            name has come this particular enzyme
            it uh catalyzes a irreversible reaction
            of pyruvate getting converted to
            acetaldehyde
            and this particular reaction requires
            thiamine pyrophosphate the tpp
            which is a transient carrier for the
            acetaldehyde group
            and also the presence of magnesium ions
            okay
            then the acetaldehyde it will undergo
            uh you can see here reduction reaction
            okay the for the reduction reaction take
            place there should be a reducing age
            and in this particular reaction it is
            nadh acts as a reducing agent
            so nadh it undergoes oxidation to
            produce nad plus
            and during this particular process it
            will uh
            like give away its hydrogen atom and
            this is being taken up by the
            acetaldehyde
            to get it itself converted into ethanol
            so acetaldehyde undergoes reduction
            with the help of nadh molecules and
            ethanol is being produced
            so uh i hope you remember that during
            the process of glycolysis
            uh the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
            getting conver
            getting i mean undergoing oxidation and
            phosphorylation during that process nad
            plus was
            being used up for the production of nadh
            and that nadh will come over here and
            act as a reducing agent
            and hence giving back the nad plus which
            can be for
            you used for the glycolytic pathway to
            keep on
            to be continued over there okay so this
            is a
            reversible process again alcohol of the
            uh reaction catalyzed by alcohol
            dehydrogenase it is a ah reversible
            reaction dehydrogenases okay so pyruvate
            it undergoes decarboxylation
            to produce acetaldehyde which undergo
            reduction to produce the ethanol
            right so this is ethanol fermentation
            okay
            and
            in the presence of oxygen uh especially
            in the case of ease
            these ease can oxidize this alcohol
            into carbon dioxide water but in the
            absence of
            oxygen what happens is this conversion
            will continue
            and alcohol will get accumulated and
            this may
            later inhibit the growth of the east the
            replication the production of yeast
            because of the increased concentration
            of alcohol in the
            system okay so this is about the ethanol
            fermentation taking place in the east
            the next one is the lactic acid
            fermentation that is the production of
            lactate or lactic acid from the
            pyruvate molecule so as uh we can see
            the pyrite molecule it undergo reduction
            to produce lactic acid okay
            c double bond o has get convert got
            converted to choh
            again here also you can see it is nadh
            is a reducing agent nadh is
            readily gives away its hydrogen atom to
            produce the nad plus
            to become the nad plus oxidized form
            okay this reaction again it is a
            uh reversible process and it is being uh
            catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase okay
            so the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme
            it will convert pyruvate to lactate uh
            it will reduce lactate dehydrogenase
            will reduce
            pyruvate to lactate with the oxidation
            of nadh molecule okay
            uh lactic acid dehydrogenase so again as
            we have already mentioned
            the nadh which is being produced during
            the
            oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate
            in the glycolytic pathway
            it is being oxidized back to nad plus
            and this nad
            plus can be uh used for i mean it can be
            like
            used for the uh glycolytic uh
            pathway and hence it can uninterruptedly
            it can continue with the process
            okay now what happens to the lactate
            lactic acid fermentation usually takes
            place in the skeletal muscles as we have
            already
            mentioned in the vertebrate skeletal
            muscle cells so this uh
            accumulation of uh lactic acid in the uh
            skeletal muscles it can actually affect
            the
            normal cell function because it is
            acidic in nature so lactic acid
            so it will reduce the ph of the
            skeletal muscle cell and the cellular ph
            is
            reduced to a very low level and this
            thus it can adversely affect the normal
            functioning of the
            cell okay so the ah usually what happens
            is if you apply
            like if auxin is available the lactic
            acid will get
            broken down and it will be removed from
            the system okay but
            the oxygen supply has to be like
            in skeletal muscles what happens is the
            oxygen supply if it is continued later
            the lactic acid can be
            removed from the system and it can
            revert back to the aerobic
            respiration okay so this is about the uh
            lactic acid fermentation we completed
            the
            aerobic um like ethanol fermentation as
            well as the lactic acid fermentation
            okay uh i hope it is clear and you have
            to uh
            learn the glycolytic uh complete
            glycolysis the 10 reactions taking place
            the enzymes
            the various uh what you call cofactors
            which are involved in wherever
            the atp is being produced substrate
            level phosphorylation is taking place
            you also have to study the fates of
            pyruvic acid and the fermentation the
            two different fermentations the
            reactions as well as the enzymes
            involved
            okay fine thank you
