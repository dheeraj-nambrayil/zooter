            hello everyone welcome back so in this
            session on metabolism we will be
            discussing on
            gluconeogenesis from substrates other
            than
            pyruvate in the previous presentation we
            looked into the
            uh gluconeogenesis from pyruvate as a
            substrate
            here we will be looking into the
            gluconeogenesis from glycerol from amino
            acids
            uh from lactate okay ah from glycerol if
            you see
            visceral is actually liberated uh in the
            adipose tissue
            during the hydrolysis of fats that is
            triglycerides when they are hydrolyzed
            they produce they
            produce what you call the fatty acids
            and glycerol
            but these glycerols can be subjected to
            gluconeogenesis
            only when it is uh like carried to or
            transported to
            liver or kidney okay because the enzyme
            glycerokinase glycerol kinase that is
            present only in the
            uh liver and kidney okay so it is absent
            in the case of adipose tissue right
            now the visceral kinase they it will
            Visceral kinase
            bring about the phosphorylation of
            glycerol to produce glycerol three
            phosphate okay it is on the third
            position
            uh the third carbon the phosphate is
            added so it is bistrol three phosphate
            and then it will get converted to
            dihydroxyacetone phosphate later
            the glycerol it is converted to glycerol
            uh three phosphate by the
            catalysis of the enzyme visceral kinase
            with the utilization of atp
            and glycerol 3 phosphate
            uh it is getting oxidized
            to produce dihydroxy acetone phosphate
            by the
            enzyme glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase
            and ah the nad plus it gets reduced to
            nadh during this
            uh reaction okay now dihydroxy acetone
            phosphate which is an intermediate in
            glycolysis
            it can be used for glucose production
            okay it
            enters the glycolytic pathway and then
            ah
            during the gluconeogenesis from pyruvate
            that i hydroxy acetone can
            enter the gluconeogenesis in that way
            Lactate
            okay
            now the next one we have is a lactate uh
            the lactate it is produced in active
            skeletal muscles during um
            like anaerobic respiration okay so
            during active uh
            when in active skeletal muscles uh what
            happens is
            uh glycolytic uh the rate of glycolysis
            may be very high but
            later on the oxidative metabolism like
            krebs cycle and
            later reactions or later processes may
            be
            slow or maybe not happening okay the
            rate of glycolysis may be very high
            than the rate of the oxidative
            metabolism
            so what happens is the pyruvate which is
            produced as a result of the glycolysis
            it may get converted to lactate and this
            lactate it will get accumulated in the
            uh what you call the skeletal muscles in
            under anaerobic uh conditions and these
            lactate it has to be then
            converted back to uh pyruvate um
            for further process metabolism okay so
            Pyruvate
            this particular reaction it will
            actually regenerate the pyruvate that
            can enter the
            gluconeogenesis ah to form the glucose
            later
            so how it happens uh the
            lactate it undergoes oxidation to
            produce pyruvic acid or pyruvate
            with the help of the enzyme lactate
            dehydrogenase
            utilizing nad plus okay nad plus it gets
            reduced to
            nadh during this process but what
            happens is the lactate
            it is produced in the muscle but it
            cannot be utilized for the synthesis of
            the glucose due to the absence of the
            enzymes required for gluconeogenesis
            okay it is not present in the
            muscles okay especially the glucose
            phosphatase and
            fructose 1 6 bisphosphates they are
            absent in the skeletal muscles okay so
            it has to be
            transported to those tissues where the
            gluconeogenesis take place that is
            mainly the
            liver so this is what actually is
            represented in the quarry cycle so the
            cycle
            it uh this cycle involves the synthesis
            of glucose in the liver
            ah from skeletal mus the what you call
            the
            lactate and the reuse of glucose uh
            synthesized by the muscle for energy
            purposes so we can see over here what
            happens
            uh lactate it is produced in the muscles
            during the glycolytic process and
            anaerobic respiration
            this lactate it is carried to the
            liver and kidney through the blood
            there what happens it undergoes uh
            conversion to pyruvate with the help of
            lactate dehydrogenase enzyme this is an
            oxidation process
            this pyruvic acid it will enter the
            gluconeogenesis
            and it produces glucose and this glucose
            can later be
            transported back to muscles ortho sites
            and others for
            being utilized for their to meet their
            glucose need okay
            this cycle is what is referred as the
            kauri cycle okay which takes place
            between
            the kidney and liver where the
            gluconeogenesis takes place
            and the muscle
