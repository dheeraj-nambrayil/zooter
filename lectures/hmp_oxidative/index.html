            hello everyone welcome to a new session
            on metabolism
            in this presentation we will be looking
            into in detail the exhaust monophosphate
            pathway or hexose monophosphate shunt
            Hexose monophosphate
            okay now why it has been given the name
            hexose monophosphate because the first
            substrate
            to initiate the hmp pathway it is
            otherwise known as h
            m and p okay hmp pathway it is
            the glucose 6 phosphate right glucose 6
            phosphate glucose is hexose
            and 6 phosphate there is only a single
            phosphate there is only a monophosphate
            on the sixth carbon of glucose
            isn't it so it is a uh what you call uh
            hexose monophosphate
            in a cell in a biological system we can
            see uh there's a hexose monophosphate
            pole
            which is composed of glucose 6 phosphate
            fructose 6 phosphate
            glucose 1 phosphate etcetera so here in
            this particular hmp pathway we can see
            glucose 6 phosphate is the first
            substrate to undergo the
            reaction or the pathway and we can also
            see the tractor 6 phosphate being
            produced as one of the final
            products in the pathway okay it is
            otherwise referred as pentose phosphate
            pathway
            that is in between the phosphorylated
            pentoses are produced and play a very
            important role in running the hmp
            uh shunt okay that is you can see here
            um the ribose phosphorylated ribose is
            being produced ribolosis
            uh and celluloses so all these are
            very important pentose uh phosphates in
            the hmp pathway okay
            phosphor gluconate pathway yet another
            name for the pathway
            uh because the first phase of the hmp
            pathway
            uh it is it can produce or it produces
            phosphor gluconate as a intermediary
            substrate okay
            then major contributions to the
            elucidation of various reactions in the
            hmp pathway was
            done by wahberg lipman dickens horika
            and hence it is also named after these
            scientists
            okay it's the wahberg lipmanticus
            horizon shunt
            okay now the pentose phosphate pathway
            it is otherwise it is considered to be
            an alternative pathway to
            direct glucose oxidation that is it is
            uh alternative pathway to glycolysis and
            tca cycle for
            glucose oxidation and it occurs in the
            cytoplasm
            uh in liver adipose tissue
            the adrenal cortex you can see it in the
            lactating mammary glands thyroid glands
            erythrocytes
            eye lens and such
            kind of organs but it is uh this hexose
            monophosphate pathway is
            not found to be operating in
            non-lactating
            mammary glands and skeletal muscles
            right
            so now the next unique feature is that
            um no atp is produced even though it is
            considered to be an
            alternative pathway to glycolysis hmp
            pathway doesn't
            produce any atp but the unique thing is
            like it is
            it produces nadph instead okay
            nadph and nadph is mainly produced
            through hexose monophosphate pathway
            okay nadh is produced atp are produced
            in every other fadh2 etc produced in
            various
            glucose oxidation pathways but nadph it
            is produced only in hexose monophosphate
            pathway
            these hmp pathway it operates in as
            already mentioned in cytoplasm
            and it supplements the glycolytic
            pathway
            and nearly almost like 10 percent of the
            glucose entering the biological system
            enter the
            hmp pathway and we can see that it is a
            major source of nadph
            and it occurs in those regions which
            require nadph
            for the biosynthetic processes for
            example
            the nadph it is required for the
            biosynthesis of fatty acids and
            cholesterol steroid and hence you can
            see nadph is
            produced via hmp pathway in adipose
            tissue and liver
            right it is also involved in the
            detoxification of
            chemicals like detoxification of drugs
            and poisons in liver
            neutralizing ammonia etc where does it
            take place it takes place in liver and
            adrenal
            uh the sorry what you call kidney
            especially in liver
            okay so these are uh the hmp pathway
            helps in providing the sufficient amount
            of nadph for all these reactions
            it also helps in the synthesis of fatty
            acids
            cholesterol and also the amino acids
            that involve glutamate dehydrogenase
            okay we can see that erythros phosphate
            which is an
            intermediary substrate formed in the
            hexose monophosphate pathway
            is required or is necessary for the
            synthesis
            of amino acids like tyrosine tryptophan
            phenylalanine right so all those
            aromatic drug
            the amino acids are being produced with
            the help of nadph right
            and the uh pentose phosphate pathway so
            the
            again it is a very important uh pathway
            for various
            biosynthetic okay then you can see that
            uh it also produces that is hex or the
            uh what you call the pentose phosphate
            pathway
            it also helps in the synthesis of
            pentoses especially phosphorylated
            pentoses
            now what is the function of pentose
            phosphates pentose phosphates
            are used for the synthesis of
            nucleotides nucleotides as well as the
            nucleic acids
            okay for example ribose 6-phosphate is
            an intermediary
            uh substrate in hmp pathway okay this
            ribosome phosphate
            and it can be used for the synthesis of
            various kinds of uh what you call
            coenzymes which involve the nucleotides
            like atp uh sorry what you call um nad
            fad etc and also it can be polymerized
            used for the polymerization and
            synthesis of nucleic acids
            okay so it do have a very important role
            the hmp pathways
            okay now we'll see the phases as already
            HMP
            mentioned the hmp pathway it can be
            divided into two phases
            that is the oxidative phase and the
            non-oxidative phase okay the oxidative
            phase it starts with glucose six
            phosphate
            and uh this undergo uh the oxidative
            phase to produce
            uh ribose five phosphate or ribulose
            five phosphate or
            cellulose 5000 okay and then
            uh this these products it will enter the
            ribose 5 phosphate and cylinders 5
            phosphate
            it will enter the non-oxidative phase
            okay and that will result in the
            formation of different kinds of pentoses
            and hexose phosphorylated hexoses
            okay so we can see the oxidative phase
            is mainly concerned with the production
            of nadph
            and carbon dioxide okay it also produce
            the pentose phosphates
            these are pentose phosphates fine and
            here you can see the hexose the glucose
            6 phosphate
            it is getting converted into pentose
            phosphate okay that is glucose 6
            phosphate which is a
            hexose phosphate it is getting converted
            to pentose phosphate in this
            oxidative phase of the hmp pathway
            in the non-oxidative phase this is a
            like represents a non-oxidative phase
            and here what happens is
            this involves a series of reactions
            by which pentose phosphate okay this is
            a pentose phosphate
            the pentose phosphates they are
            converted to intermediate products of
            um glycolytic pathway like glucose 6
            phosphate or fructose 6 phosphate
            or glycerol they had three phosphate so
            all these are intermediate substrates of
            glycolysis isn't it so the here
            now in the non-oxidative phase you can
            see the uh pentose phosphates are
            converted to intermediate substrates of
            the
            uh glycolytic pathway okay and these
            intermediate
            products can enter the uh what you call
            glycolytic pathway or it can be
            channeled back to the
            pentose phosphate pathway okay either
            way it can enter the
            uh what you call uh cycles okay now we
            can
            just look into in detail the oxidative
            and the non-oxidative phases
            okay uh in the oxidative phase the first
            phase is dehydrogenation of the glucose
            6-phosphate
            the glucose 6-phosphate it undergo um
            you can see here yeah oxidation okay we
            can see it undergoes
            oxidation to produce uh six
            phosphogluconol lactone
            this particular reaction is catalyzed by
            nadp dependent glucose six phosphate
            dehydrogenase
            okay this is nadp it is oxidizing agent
            it undergoes
            a reduction to produce nadph that's the
            first nadph molecule to be produced here
            okay the six phosphor uh gluconolactone
            it undergoes
            hydrolysis okay water is added and ah
            it undergoes hydrolysis to produce six
            phosphor gluconate
            right and this uh reaction is catalyzed
            by the enzyme
            lactones ah even the this particular
            reaction can even under
            take place without uh the end help of
            the enzyme but the reaction rate which
            will be
            slow okay so lactones it uh
            hydrolyzes six phosphor gluconolactone
            to produce
            six phosphor gluconate okay then
            this one the six phosphor gluconate it
            undergo
            decarboxylation oxidative
            decarboxylation to produce
            ribulose five phosphate okay so this
            will uh
            the six phosphor gluconate it undergoes
            you can see dehydrogenation the hydrogen
            which is released from here
            it will be taken up by the nadp and get
            converted to nadph that's the second
            molecule of nadph being produced
            okay and the carboxylation it will
            result in the release of a carbon
            dioxide molecule
            okay since a carbon is released what
            happens till here it is a six carbon
            uh compound is it here you have six
            carbons in the chain
            right but when carbon carbon one carbon
            is
            released as carbon dioxide what happens
            it will become a pentose
            okay so the six carbon six phosphor
            glucono uh
            i mean gluconate it is getting converted
            to five carbon
            regulars five phosphate by the
            carboxylation and oxidation this
            catalyzed
            the reaction is catalyzed by six phospho
            gluconate dehydrogenase okay as
            already mentioned it is a nadp dependent
            enzyme and it also requires magnesium or
            manganese ions
            the presence of these ions okay now uh
            here you can see
            the aldo hexose phosphate okay this is
            the aldos
            first for all those okay it is aldo
            hexose
            phosphorylated aldo hexose it is getting
            converted to
            phosphorylated keto pentose ribulosa is
            a ketose
            you can see here this is a keto okay a
            phosphorylated aldo hexose gets
            converted to
            phosphorylated keto pentose in the
            oxidative phase okay and uh
            later this you can see that the rebulos
            5-phosphate is the one which actually
            enter the
            what you call the next phase but before
            that it can
            uh take up interconversion okay uh the
            interconversion of
            the pentose phosphates that is a
            ribulose phi phosphate
            it can undergo a reversible you can see
            it is a reverse reaction a reversible
            isomerization to produce ribose
            phi phosphate okay uh it results in the
            formation of
            ribose 5 phosphate which is a aldopentos
            you can see it is aldos
            right cho right ah this regulus 5
            phosphate it can
            also undergo epimerization to produce
            cellulose 5-phosphate you can see the
            cellulose body phosphate okay
            now so uh ribulose rebulos 5-phosphate
            it can undergo epimerization
            resulting in the formation of cylinders
            5 phosphate and
            the reaction being catalyzed by pentose
            phosphate epimeres
            while it can undergo isomerization to
            ribose 5 phosphate the reaction being
            catalyzed by
            phosphopentose isomerase okay
            now in a reaction you can see here in a
            what you call hmp reaction two molecules
            of cellulose 5-phosphate and one
            molecule of ribose 5-phosphate are
            required for
            to take up the non-oxidative phase of
            the hmp pathway that is to pass on to
            the next
            step they need the formation of one
            molecule of
            ribose phi phosphate and two molecule
            was cellulose five phosphate
            okay so this is where the oxidative
            reaction
            stopped now it starts the non-oxidative
            reaction that is here nadh is not being
            produced that is it okay in this
            particular phase
            now
