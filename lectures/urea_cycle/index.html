heveryone
welcome back to a new session on
metabolism in this session we'll be
dealing with urea cycle
you can see there are three groups of
organs based upon the kind of excretory
products
whether it is ammonia uric acid or urea
the
monotonic animals we can see
they are
those animals which produce
ammonia as excretory product and you can
see the these include the aquatic
organisms in aquatic i mean in the case
of aquatic organisms what happens is the
excretory product is mainly ammonia and
this ammonia is water-soluble uh it is
toxic again it cannot be stored in the
cells it as soon as it is being produced
it has to be expelled out so what
happens is since it is uh soluble in
water the um the aquatic organisms they
do have the laser to get its dissolve in
water and be get it expelled out in the
form of ammonia but in the case of the
terrestrial organisms uh they don't uh
uh have the leisure to
waste water
for uh removing the excretory product in
the form of ammonia so they have shifted
or they have changed their uh like
excretory product to form urea or uric
acid okay so based upon whether it is
urea or uric acid we have eureotheric
animals and eurotillic animals the
eurotealic animals they are terrestrial
vertebrates including humans and there
the ammonia which is produced as a
result of the protein metabolism it is
being converted to urea okay and this is
what is referred as the urea cycle okay
Urea cycle
so in urdiotilic organisms the ammonia
which is produced as a result of protein
metabolism uh it is depicted in
mitochondria of liver cells and is
converted into urea and this is what is
referred as a urea cycle so this is what
is a urea cycle an outline is this
pathway it was discovered in 1932
by
hans crips and curtains elite and hence
the cycle is also referred as krebs hans
elite cycle so urea it is one of the end
product of protein metabolism or the
amino acid metabolism and the nitrogen
of amino acids it gets converted to
ammonia okay this is what uh the basic
uh
like basis of urea cycle is and this
ammonia it is getting converted to uh it
enters the urea cycle and get itself
converted to urea which is being
expelled out in uriotanic animals okay
so um the urea production occurs
almost exclusively in the liver in the
liver uh it is actually
urea it is being produced and then this
urea it passes into the
bloodstream
and reaches the kidneys where it is
again
getting excreted in the form of urine
okay so you can see here um
the
hepatocyte olivasa where the whole thing
refer this cycle refer to the urea cycle
and you can see it is getting completed
in the cytosol and mitochondria okay so
the enzymes which are involved in the
urea cycle it is present in
the
mitochondrial matrix and the rest are
present in the cytoplasm so hence the
urea cycle spans in spans the
cytoplasm and mitochondria of the liver
Step by step process
cells okay now we can see the
step-by-step process the first step is
the formation of citrulline so urea
cycle it is accomplished through four
steps the first step is formation of
citrulline so i hope the picture is
clear over here
this is mitochondria uh of the liverson
and this represents the cytosol okay so
um you can see here the aloe 9 from the
muscle the other amino acids
and
the glutamine okay so these gets
converted to glutamate okay lr9 from
muscles amino acids etc it gets
converted to uh
glutamate or glutamic acid okay and this
enters the mitochondria
the glutamine
from the extra hepatic tissues that
other than
liver cells it gets transported to liver
it enters the mitochondria and it
undergoes uh
conversion to glutamate with the help of
the enzyme glutamines okay
so glutamate it is produced through
various sources that's it okay this
glutamate is the uh it undergoes
deamination process
uh during which ammonia is being
produced
the same thing the glutamate it and gets
converted to its corresponding alpha
keto acid that is ketoglutaric acid this
deamination process is just being
catalyzed by the enzyme glutamate
dehydrogenase fine now the ammonia which
is being produced as a result it uh
Carbomoyl phosphate
undergoes conversion to carbomole
phosphate okay the enzyme is carbamoyl
phosphate synthetase one okay uh carbon
oil phosphate synthetase one of the
mitochondria it catalyzes the
condensation of ammonia ions with you
can see here the carbon dioxide
bicarbonate okay carbon dioxide to form
the carbon oil phosphate and here you
can see two atp molecules are consumed
and it is a irreversible process okay
this is a irreversible process
and you can see that
the carbamoyl phosphate is the one which
actually gets into the urea cycle this
is the urea cycle okay the cyclic path
pattern you see it is the urea cycle
okay so carbomoyl phosphate is the one
which enters the um what you call the
urea cycle okay so it is involved in the
citrulline formation and that is the
first step of the urea cycle so what
happens is the
citrulline
it is here you can see it is synthesized
from
ornithine and carbomoil phosphate and
the whole process it is catalyzed by the
ornithine trans carbomylases okay this
is the enzyme
now you can see here
this is the carbomoly phosphate is the
first
is the
first substrate to take ammonia into the
urea cycle or we can say it is the uh
the first amino group to enter
the
uh the urea cycle it is in the form of
carbon oil phosphate okay so here you
can see the ornithine it combines with
carbon oil phosphate to produce the
citrulline okay and the
enzyme responsible is ornithine trans
okay and uh
the ornithine and citrulline these are
amino acids basic amino acids but they
are not the
amino acids or proteogenic amino acids
they are not involved in the protein
structure okay but it is being
transported to uh the mitochondria the
liver cells where it can be used for the
synthesis of the um whole process okay
it can be used for the urea cycle now
the citrulline is formed fine the next
step we have is the formation of
arginino succinate okay and ah
this is here you can see this is the
arginino succinate over here okay this
is arginino succiny okay and you can see
citrulline it gets converted to argino
succinate through an intermediate which
is known as citrulline
amp intermediate okay so what happens
citrulline
during this reaction the uh
citrulline it condenses with aspartate
you can see here the aspartate okay the
second step it occurs in two
steps actually the second reaction
citrulline to add no succinate it takes
place in two steps in the first step atp
is being used up right and it results in
the formation of citrulline amp
intermediate and here this particular
intermediate it uh undergoes
condensation with aspartate aspartic
acid okay and this will result in argino
succinate okay so we can say in uh
in nutshell it is actually citrulline it
condenses with aspartate to produce
arginine succinate okay uh the sa the
this you can see the aspartic acid is
the second amino acid to be involved
isn't it and hence here there is a
second amino group this amino group is
include introduced into the urea cycle
so the first amino group it entered from
here isn't it the carbo oil phosphate
was the first contributor of the
amino group into this
urea cycle the second amino group
is introduced at this
level you can see here where uh the
arduino succinate is being produced okay
so this is the second step and here
again atp is getting converted is being
used up
and amp is being released okay atp is
getting converted to amp
and this it is being used up okay now
arginine
the next step is formation of arginine
arginino succinate it will give rise to
arginine with the release of fumarate
the fumarate which will enter the uh the
the citric acid cycle okay so here this
the enzyme involves arginino succinates
okay argento succinate it undergoes uh
actually cleavage isn't it and this is
being uh catalyzed by the enzyme
arginine succines so as you know
succinate cleaves arginosuccinate
to give rise to arginine and fumarate
okay this fumarate it enters the tca
cycle or you can say
the gluconeogenesis or some other
such other metabolic pathways okay so we
have the arginine now now this arginine
you can see it is diamino
amino acid isn't it and this arginine it
uh
like contributes or it undergoes
reaction where ornithine is regenerated
and urea is being produced okay so the
fourth step is the formation of urea
here okay so what happens during these
spruces the arginine
actually you can see here the this is
catalyzed by the enzyme arginines okay
so arginase it cleaves arginine
to yield urea and ornithine okay so here
or nitin is getting regenerated and this
ornithin it will enter the mitochondrial
matrix okay and you can see what all
things are required water molecule is
required here okay and
the uh
arginine enzyme it require the
coenz as coenzymes or cofactors we can
say it requires cobalt and manganese
ions okay so arjunas is
mostly found in the liver and while the
rest of the enzymes
are also present in other
what you call the
arjuna
tissues okay arjuna is specifically
found in the liver so it is very
important in urea cycle okay so we can
just see uh the urea cycle the for the
four step process it is a urea cycle the
first one is the formation of citrulline
which takes place inside the
mitochondria okay and this here what
happens is carbam oil phosphate it
condenses with ornithine resulting in
the formation of citrulline and
carbomoyl phosphate is the first uh like
amino group contributor to the
urea cycle this reaction is catalyzed by
ornithine trans carbon carboylase and it
takes place inside the mitochondria the
citrulline produced it gets transported
into the cytosol where the rest of the
urea cycle is completed the citrulline
it undergoes conversion to form arginino
succinate uh where aspartate and atp is
being used up that is aspartate is the
second amino group contributor over here
the first one was carbon oil phosphate
and the second is aspartate uh
they are the amino group contributors
now citrulline it gets converted to
argino succinate which undergo cleavage
to produce arginine and fumarate this
arginine it uh again undergoes cleavage
with the help of the enzyme arginines to
produce urea and ornithin this urea
produced is still in the liver cells
asylum now this it gets transported to
the kidneys uh through blood and from
there it will get expelled out okay
during the excretory process so this is
excretory
urea cycle so you can see it is in a
nutshell the ammonia plus carbon dioxide
it gets that is um i mean uh amino acids
they are getting converted to these one
broken downers and and then uh the
carboxylation deamination process and
these and uh you can see here it gets
converted to carbohydrate phosphate with
the help of carbo more phosphate
synthetase one and this it combines with
ornithine uh to produce a citrulline and
then this citrulline it moves out okay
this is mitochondria and this is cytosol
okay this moves out into the cytosol
where it combines with aspartate
utilizing atp
it gets converted into arginino
succinate which gets cleaved into
fumarate and arginine and this arginine
further it cleaves into urea and or
nitin the urea it gets transported to
kidney for excretion so overall equation
we can say the of the urea cycle is
ammonium
the carbon dioxide i hope you remember
where the carbon dioxide comes into
isn't it it is this way
for the formation of carbon oil
phosphate okay so the uh bicarbonate uh
carbon dioxide in the form of
bicarbonate ion then atp molecules and
water is being used up for the
production of urea adp
inorganic phosphate amp and hydrogen
ions so this is about the urea cycle now
why urea cycle is very important you can
see if urea is not produced okay if uni
is not produced this ammonia it gets
build up okay it will they can it gets
accumulated okay and this
will result in hyper ammonia that is
ammonia concentration in blood it may
increase okay this may lead to toxicity
ammonia is toxic so it may lead to
toxicity and if the concentration is too
high it is going to cause uh actually uh
affect most of the parts of the body
even the brain cells okay so here uh
what you call the urea cycle is so very
important to bring down the uh
concentration of the ammonia okay
the it may affect the uh like normal
functioning of the body um normal
functioning of the cells uh it causes
vomiting mental retardation accumulation
of ammonia and the cells of brain etc
okay fine thank you
