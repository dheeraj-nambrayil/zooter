            hello everyone welcome back uh to the
            session in metabolism here we will be
            dealing with
            the redox station fatty acids we'll be
            continuing with the sikkim stem we
            already saw that the oxidation it takes
            place in three stages the first stage
            where the fatty acid is getting um
            activated uh to fatty acid enzyme
            and then it this is happening in
            cytoplasm and then this fatty cell
            coenzyme is getting transported through
            the mitochondrial membrane to reach the
            mitochondrial matrix where the detox
            station proper the reactions are going
            on because the enzymes which are
            required for the beta oxidation process
            it is present in the mitochondrial
            matrix okay so here you can see um
            the activation of uh fatty acid it has
            already been dealt in the previous
            presentation here looking into the the
            second and the third step okay the
            second step is carnitine shuttle okay so
            fatty acid coenzyme which is being
            produced in the cytoplasm has to be
            transported to the
            mitochondrial matrix and what happens is
            the uh
            outer mitochondrial membrane uh is not a
            hurdle for the transportation but in the
            mitochondrial membrane is obviously it
            is uh it needs a like the fatty cell
            coenzyme it needs a carrier protein or a
            transportation system for it to cross
            the inner mitochondrial membrane and
            that is where the carnitine molecule uh
            comes up okay carnitine mediated
            shuttling it is uh
            it takes place that so that the fatty
            acyl coenzyme a it can get transported
            through the inner mitochondrial membrane
            and reached the mitochondrial matrix so
            how it happens now before that what does
            actually uh carnitine carnitine it is a
            zwitter ionic alcohol uh chemically if
            we see it is a
            high beta hydroxy
            uh
            gamma trimethyl ammonium butyrate okay
            leave those parts it is an alcoholic
            molecule a zitra ionic alcohol
            and uh
            you can see here uh the fatty acyl
            coenzyme a
            during the carnitine shuttle it reaches
            the outer surface so this is the inner
            mitochondrial membrane
            the carnitine it is found on the
            outer surface of the inner mitochondrial
            membrane okay now the fatty acyl
            coenzyme a
            it binds with
            uh the
            carnitine
            okay
            and you can see this reaction is a
            reversible reaction so it acid the fatty
            acid enzyme it binds with carnitine on
            the outer side of the inner
            mitochondrial membrane okay and this
            reaction it results in the formation of
            fatty acyl carbonate and during this
            process coenzyme is released now this
            fatty acyl carnitine is the one which is
            going to get transported into through
            the inner mitochondrial membrane the
            whole reaction it is catalyzed by the
            carnitine acyl transfer is one or we can
            say ca t1 cat1 okay now the fatty acyl
            carbonating one it
            can cross the inner mitochondrial
            membrane to raise the mitochondrial
            matrix with the help of a carrier
            protein and this carrier protein it is
            nothing but the carnitine translocase
            enzyme here you can see the
            the membrane isn't it it is a uh
            carnitine
            translocase
            translocation this is uh like changing
            the location isn't it so here from cyto
            cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix that
            is what the carrot protein is doing
            isn't it so here it is
            carnitine translocase that is a
            carrier protein so it helps in the
            facilitated diffusion of the acyl
            carnitine from the
            outer
            surface of the inner mitochondrial
            membrane to the mitochondrial matrix
            okay so now it it acyle carnitine it
            moves through the
            the inner mitochondrial membrane and it
            reaches the inner side of the
            inner mitochondrial membrane but
            reaching over here what happens is ah
            the carnitine has to be released and
            fatty acid compound has to be uh
            like
            changed back into acyl coenzymes so that
            it can enter the beta oxidation proper
            and this is taking place with the help
            of the next enzyme it is cat2 carnitine
            esl transplace ii so what happens is the
            acyl carnitine it combines with the
            coenzyme a and it results in the
            formation of fatty acyl coenzyme so the
            fatty cell coenzyme is regenerated here
            and carnitine is regenerated again okay
            it releases carnitine and this carnitine
            it will get transported back to the
            outer surface of the inner mitochondrial
            membrane so as to be used
            for uh the transportation or
            translocation of a new fatty acid
            coenzyme okay now ah this um uh like um
            uh transportation of carnitine back
            to the outer surface is also done with
            the help of the carrier protein carbon
            transfer case okay now what happens here
            okay this uh acyl carbonate fatty
            it combines with coenzyme a and produces
            fatty acyl coenzyme and carnitine and
            this is also done by another
            carnitine sl transplants specifically
            the c82 okay so this is about the
            carnitine shuttle where the fatty is
            alcohol enzyme a it gets transported
            across the inner mitochondrial membrane
            to the matrix with the help of carnotin
            carnitine translocase carrier protein
            and carnitine sile transfer is one and
            two enzymes okay i hope it is clear now
            the fatty acyl coenzyme is present in
            the mitochondrial matrix now it can
            enter the beta oxidation proper so this
            is a beta oxidation proper which is
            taking place in the
            mitochondrial matrix now if you look
            into the uh beta oxidation proper it
            takes place in uh four steps okay the
            first is oxidation dehydrogenation or
            oxidation second step it is a hydration
            third it is dehydrogenation or oxidation
            again fourth is thiolysis or thiolitic
            cleavage okay we'll see step by step the
            first step is oxidation or
            dehydrogenation right so this is the
            fatty cell coenzyme which has reached
            the mitochondrial matrix it undergoes
            dehydrogenation that is it is oxidation
            itself right so it's true it is being uh
            released from fatty acyl coenzyme and
            during this process uh double bond is
            introduced now um
            so double bond is introduced between
            these two so this is the first carbon
            you have to make number it from the side
            isn't that this is a functional group so
            first carbon second carbon third carbon
            so it is between the second and the
            third carbon okay since this is a
            functional group we call this as alpha
            carbon and beta carbon and continuing
            gamma and
            likewise okay so uh double bond is
            produced as a result of dehydrogenation
            and this double bond is created between
            the alpha and the beta carbon or the
            second and the third carbon okay and the
            high this
            undergoes dehydrogenation with the help
            of the oxidizing agent fad the coenzyme
            fad which gets reduced to fadh2 okay so
            fad is the uh electron acceptor or we
            can say the hydrogen acceptor okay and
            what is
            produced it is a uh enol compound
            because it is a double bond over here so
            it is enol coenzyme a transient oil
            coenzyme okay a double bond is produced
            now this transient oil coenzyme you can
            see here that is a
            first reaction fatty is algoins i mean
            getting dehydrogenated to produce trans
            enol coenzyme now what does this
            indicate it does it this indicates the
            uh
            like uh double bone where it is pretty
            uh present it is on the second carbon
            okay so it is on the second carbon
            between the second and third okay there
            is only one double bond that is why
            there is only one number if there were
            more you could have found two comma the
            next number etcetera okay coming back it
            is transient oil coenzyme
            now the transient coenzyme it undergoes
            hydration that is a water molecule is
            added to the double bond over here okay
            so as a result uh you can see a hydroxyl
            compound is produced so hydroxyl group
            is added on to the third carbon here
            okay so what does the product produce it
            is
            three hydroxy acyl coenzyme okay it is
            just like this one but only one thing is
            instead of hydrogen over here on the
            third carbon it does hydroxyl group so
            the name changes to three hydroxy acyl
            coenzyme and this reaction is it
            catalyzed by enol enzyme a hydrotase
            okay now uh the three hydroxyl
            enzyme a produced as a result of
            hydration it undergoes dehydrogenation
            or it is a oxidation process so this is
            the second oxidation step or second a
            dehydrogenation step okay now here it is
            nad plus is the
            hydrogen acceptor or it is the oxidizing
            agent as a result of which the hydrogen
            atoms two hydrogen atoms are being
            released and in ad plus it gets
            converted to nadh and every hydrogen ion
            is being produced it is released okay
            now what happens to three hydroxy acyl
            coins i mean the three hydroxy esl
            coenzyme a it gets converted into beta
            keto salco enzyme why it is beta keto
            because because it is beta carbon is in
            the keto form okay the it is
            a fatty salt enzyme itself only the
            difference is beta carbon is in the keto
            form so we have beta keto acyl coenzyme
            okay but how is beta ketosal coenzyme
            produced it is by the dehydrogenation of
            three hydroxy acyl coenzyme the reaction
            is catalyzed by three hydroxy acyl
            coenzyme a dehydrogenase it is very easy
            to learn the names isn't it because
            three hydroxy salco enzyme is the
            substrate it undergoes dehydrogenation
            and hence the enzyme three hydroxy cell
            coenzyme a dehydrogenase okay now the
            last on the fourth reaction or the
            fourth step it is the thiolysis okay
            here what happens is a coenzyme is being
            used here okay so beta ketosal coenzyme
            it combines with or reacts with a
            molecule of coenzyme a and split
            of the ammonium and split off to produce
            or to release acetyl coenzyme so how it
            is being produced the added
            coenzyme a from there the hydrogen over
            here it is getting added to
            here okay so it so a bone is broke
            broken over here and uh the whole
            coenzyme a we can see the hydrogen is
            added here so it has become
            ch3coscoa which is acetylchoensy
            okay and it becomes c double bond o s c
            o a okay so it is another acetyl um
            fatty acid coenzyme okay now what does
            the difference of this fatty alpha
            coenzyme and this one the initial one
            the initial one had you can see here
            what you call ch3ch2n then again three
            carbon okay two carbon and
            uh what we call uh see the c double bond
            o seo right but over here what has
            happened
            those two carbons have been lost or have
            been released as acetyl coenzyme okay so
            we can see that the fatty cell coenzyme
            a which is produced from this particular
            substrate is actually two carbon less in
            length okay so the length of the fatty
            cell coenzyme produced after beta
            oxidation is two carbon less in length
            okay now this fatty cell coenzyme it can
            again enter the beta oxidation and it
            can take uh undergo oxidation
            hydration second oxidation
            thiolysis and produce a molecule of
            acetyl coenzyme and another fatty acyl
            coenzyme which is having
            length two carbon less than this one
            okay so this can
            continue till we have uh
            the um complete oxidation
            that is uh finally what we will have is
            a fatty acyl coenzyme will split into
            two acetyl coenzyme so till then this
            reaction can continue okay so that is
            about the beta oxidation proper
            i hope this is clear
            now we will see the uh
            with an example right so this is the
            summary a fatty acid it has undergone uh
            activation to produce a cyan coenzyme
            and with the help of translocase enzyme
            and the carnitine shuttle it enters the
            mitochondrial matrix where the fatty
            acyl coenzyme it undergoes oxidation it
            undergoes a hydration right in oil
            compound right and uh then hydroxy
            compound is produced it undergoes
            oxidation the second oxidation uh and
            then they have the cleavage thiolite
            cleavage okay acetyl-coa enzyme is
            produced this is the coenzyme can enter
            the krebs cycle isn't it and it can uh
            contribute to the
            atp is being produced okay now this is
            one example it's a c17 molecule you can
            see here it does uh see one carbon over
            here 14 carbon then you have uh
            uh one more carbon isn't it so 14 15 16
            okay so here we have this uh you can see
            how many
            yeah so it is c uh 16 compound uh
            the fatty acid how many uh uh what asyl
            acetyl coins i may have produced from c
            uh fatty as a c16 fatty acid will give
            rise to eight acetyl coenzyme
            right along with this seven fadh2 seven
            nadh are being produced right and i hope
            you remember uh during the acetylation
            or activation one atp molecule is being
            used up right so it is minus two so all
            together what happens is seven nadh
            is used produced seven fadh2 it is being
            produced at the same time atp molecule
            is
            being used up
            okay for a molecule
            for a molecule of fatty acid with uh
            what you call
            16 carbon now here you can see this
