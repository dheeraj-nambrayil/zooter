            hello everyone welcome back we'll be
            continuing with the metabolism of amino
            acids
            in the previous presentation we
            concluded uh with
            the types of deamination that is
            oxidative deamination
            reductive deamination hydrolytic or
            non-oxidative deamination
            and intramolecular deamination in this
            presentation we will be looking in
            detail the oxidative deamination
            so what is oxidative deamination the
            amination is removal of
            ammonia free ammonia and oxidative
            because the whole reaction is coupled
            with oxidation
            so oxidative deamination it is the
            oxidative removal of the amino group
            from amino acids
            okay here the whole reaction it is
            coupled with oxidation
            so it is almost we can see it is a redox
            reaction okay
            and this uh process it is very important
            when an organism has more nitrogen in
            the nutrient
            than what is required okay and here you
            can see since ammonia is released it
            becomes a source for urea synthesis
            and apart from ammonia the amino acid
            the main carbon skeleton of
            amino acid it gets converted to keto
            acid the alpha keto acid
            and the alpha keto acid can enter
            various
            other reactions the whole oxidative
            deamination mainly occurs
            in liver and kidney because the enzymes
            required are present in these organ
            organs
            the process it is stereo specific it is
            catalyzed by l
            and d amino acid oxidases so these
            enzymes are stereospecific in the sense
            l amino acid oxidases they act upon l
            amino acids and d amino acid oxidases it
            acts upon d amino acid they are stereo
            specific the first step
            we can see it is the removal of two
            hydrogen atoms by the flavin coenzyme
            with the formation of an unstable
            intermediary alpha amino acid
            intermediate
            okay this intermediate undergoes
            decomposition by addition of water
            and forms ammonium ion and corresponding
            alpha keto acid
            okay we can see over here so this is the
            whole process what was explained
            that is it splits an amino acid the
            whole of the process it will split
            amino acid to ammonia and the
            corresponding alpha keto acid
            the whole ah reaction is catalyzed by
            the oxidases enzyme amino acid oxidases
            or we can say amino acid dehydrogenases
            and here the oxidation it is carried out
            with oxidizing
            ah agent that is a flavin ah
            usually flavin coenzymes okay it could
            be fmn
            or fad okay so with the help of this
            coins and the enzyme oxidases it will
            help in
            splitting the alpha amino acid to the
            respective keto acid and ammonia
            now as already mentioned it takes place
            in two steps the first step
            is oxidation and the second step is
            hydrolysis in the first step what
            happens is
            the alpha amino acid it undergoes
            dehydrogenation
            uh with the oxidizing agent flavin
            and the enzyme amino acid oxidases
            okay the fmn or fad it becomes oxidizing
            agent which receives the hydrogen which
            is removed from the alpha amino acid
            so here you can see the hydrogen over
            here and the hydrogen from the ammonia
            it is being released and as a result
            the resultant product is a amino acid c
            double bond in
            isn't it amino acid alpha amino acid
            okay
            so this uh flavin it takes up the
            hydrogen atoms and it gets converted to
            flavin h
            it could be fadh2 from fad and fm nh2
            from fmn
            okay it gets reduced right so alpha
            amino acid it doesn't intermediate it is
            highly unstable and it undergoes
            spontaneous hydrolysis addition of water
            you can see over here
            it is spontaneous hydrolystic
            deamination that this hydrolysis takes
            place at the same time ammonia is
            released
            so the this particular enzyme catalyzes
            the conversion of alpha amino acid to
            the alpha keto acid okay the
            uh what all are the products now here we
            have reduced fmn or fad uh
            reduced apha fmn we have ammonia we have
            alpha keto acid so what will happen to
            each of these we can see
            okay the reduced fadh2 or fmnh2 they
            get spontaneously reoxidized to form the
            fmn rfad
            by molecular oxygen with the help of
            molecular oxygen which itself get
            reduced from hydrogen peroxide
            and this particular reaction it is
            catalyzed by the
            catalysis the enzyme and these catalase
            the enzyme it is present
            in the peroxisomes and glyoxysomes okay
            now what happens to ammonia ammonia
            enters the urea cycle
            okay uh it is used for the synthesis of
            urea
            and uh we can see ammonia it is a
            toxic product and in a monotelic animals
            that is where the
            uh animals excrete um uh in uh ex in um
            well nitrogenous compound the waste
            produced by nitrogenous
            metabolism as ammonium in them it is
            excreted as such
            but in others it gets detoxified uh
            forming glutamine or uric acid etc
            okay coming to alpha keto acids alpha
            keto acids it will enter the
            uh mainly the kreb cycle okay we can see
            in
            examples later now this is d amino acid
            actually for protein synthesis
            it is l amino acid being utilized uh
            while the amino acid it is not useful
            for protein synthesis it is not used up
            but when it is subjected to oxidative
            deamination with the help of the enzyme
            d amino acid oxidases it gets converted
            to alpha keto acid
            this alpha keto acid on a reamination
            that is addition of amine group again
            during transamination process which will
            result in an amino acid and the cell
            amino acid is metabolically active and
            can be used for the protein synthesis
            okay so even conversion of the amino
            acid to metabolically active in amino
            acid can help
            take place with the help of the process
            fine
            so this is a specific example glutamate
            okay glutamate it undergoes
            uh oxidation over here that is the first
            step and then hydrolytic
            deamination okay so oxidation uh it
            results in the formation of uh amino
            group
            and then hydrolysis it will result in
            alpha ketoglutarate
            okay i hope you remember alpha
            ketoglutarate was an intermediate prod
            substrate in krebs cycle okay so this is
            oxidative deamination
            the second one is non-oxidative
            deamination or hydrolytic deamination
            here the major enzymes which are
            involved is amino acid dehydrates
            and amino acid desulphide race amino
            acid dehydrates it deaminates amino
            acids
            which contain hydroxyl groups and these
            enzymes are present
            in liver so the whole reaction takes
            place in the liver now which are
            the hydroxyl containing amino acids they
            are
            threonine serene and homozygous okay
            and you can see here the first step in
            this particular reaction
            it is uh the dehydrolysis
            okay or dehydration we can sorry it's
            not high dehydration
            dehydration okay dehydration which is
            followed by hydrolysis okay
            so it is dehydration water is removed so
            uh serine
            it undergoes uh non-oxidative
            deamination results in the formation of
            an unstable amino acid intermediate
            product
            okay and this undergoes uh hydrolysis to
            give rise to
            pyruvic acid the so the first step is
            hydration
            um and the second it is followed by the
            hydrolytic
            deamination okay and this results in the
            formation of keto acid and ammonia
            the whole process is uh catalyzed by
            serine dehydrators okay serene is
            undergoing the
            process of serene dehydrates and the
            coenzyme required it is period oxide
            phosphate or we can say plp okay the
            next one is d sulfhydrase
            so this enzyme uh it is present in liver
            kidney and pancreas
            and the enzyme it catalyzes uh
            deamination of sulphur containing amino
            acids
            like cysteine okay and uh cysteine
            homocysteine etc
            the first step in the whole reaction it
            is the sulfhydry
            uh desulf hydration that is removal of
            hydrogen sulfide h2s
            and this is followed by the
            uh hydrolytic deamination okay the first
            step uh
            h2s removal of h2s ah it is
            uh it results in the formation of alpha
            amino acid from the system
            okay and the hydrolytic deamination it
            will result in the formation of pyruvic
            acid
            okay again the d sulfhydrases also
            require periodoxal phosphate as the co
            enzyme
            okay i hope it is clear so this is the
            example here you can see
            the specific dehydrators okay serene and
            homoserine
            it undergoes uh dehydration uh with the
            help of
            dehydrators and the enzyme spirit uh
            coenzyme requires periodoxal phosphate
            it will result in the formation of an
            unstable alpha amino acid
            this will undergo hydrolysis and
            deamination to result in the formation
            of alpha ketone acid
            okay then there's a summary of
            deamination oxidative deamination
            the l amino acid will give rise to alpha
            keto acid and ammonia
            right first one it is uh oxidation and
            then second one it is hydraulic
            deamination
            the steps uh involved okay non-oxidative
            deamination
            it does uh dehydrates and d subhydrosis
            involved
            okay so this is you can see here
            oxidative deamination it involves
            l amino acid oxidases d amino oxidases
            and glutamine dehydrogenase
            and non-oxidative deamination two
            enzymes dehydrators and
            desalinators are involved in the
            catalysis okay so this is all about the
            deamination thank you
