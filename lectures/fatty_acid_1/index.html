            hello everyone welcome back to a new
            session in metabolism in this
            presentation we'll be looking into the
            beta oxidation of fatty acids
            uh fatty acids it is produced by the
            hydraulic breakdown of
            lipids which on hydrolysis or breakdown
            it gives fatty acids and glycerol
            especially the triglycerides we are
            speaking
            tried or monoglystrites when it is
            broken down it
            releases the uh fatty acids and glycerol
            these uh enter the uh
            circulation medium so the and reaches
            the cells right and the main pathway of
            fatty acid oxidation in the cells it is
            beta oxidation there are different types
            which are named alpha beta gamma but the
            beta oxidation is the major pathway for
            the fatty acid oxidation in the cells
            the oxidation of fatty acids it was
            first studied by noob
            in 1904 and later it was linen and his
            co-workers
            in 1954 who studied the major enzymatic
            pathways of the beta oxidation
            specifically okay and hence the
            detoxification of fatty acid it is
            otherwise referred as nope linen cycle
            this particular oxidative pathway it
            occurs in all the tissues except drain
            erythrocytes adrenal medulla and in
            these tissues it takes place in the
            mitochondrial matrix so here you can see
            uh the major uh what you call atp
            production takes place in the
            respiratory chain or electron transfer
            transport chain okay and this is the
            final uh energy producing uh pathway
            which occurs in the mitochondria and the
            various molecules or substrates required
            for the running of these electron
            transport chain
            uh they are being produced through
            glycolysis krebs cycle pathway as well
            as beta oxidation pathway okay so you
            can see beta oxidation pathway it is a
            very major contributor to the uh atp
            production
            now we'll see what happens here
            uh so the beta oxidation it's uh
            takes place inside the mitochondria
            because the major enzymes required for
            the uh
            what you call the oxidation it is inside
            it is found inside the mitochondrial
            matrix but fatty acids they reach the
            cell and it is uh
            it gets into what you call it is present
            in the cytoplasm okay they are actually
            synthesized in the cytoplasm fatty acids
            are present in the cytoplasm
            ah so it has to be taken the fatty acids
            have to be taken from the cytoplasm so
            this is the cytoplasm and this is the
            mitochondria and this is the
            mitochondrial membrane okay so the outer
            mitochondrial membrane the inner
            mitochondrial membrane we are speaking
            about this one okay the outer
            mitochondrial membrane the inner
            mitochondrial membrane and the space
            inside it is filled with mitochondrial
            matrix so the enzymes are present in the
            mitochondrial matrix while uh the fatty
            acid is present in the cyto cytoplasm
            okay so fatty acid is present over here
            this fatty acid has to be transported
            through the mitochondrial membrane and
            it has to be taken to my matrix where it
            is getting uh it is going to enter the
            detox station pathway okay so this is
            how it uh happens now um what does detox
            station specifically now when you speak
            about beta oxidation uh it is uh
            it may be defined as the oxidation of uh
            fatty acids on the beta carbon atom of
            the uh fatty acid okay so beta carbon uh
            beta position of uh
            this one it is actually um
            yeah we can see here
            okay we'll see in the when it comes to
            over there where the detox station
            proper okay so it is successive
            separation beta oxidation if we study if
            we define it is actually the successive
            removal of two carbon units in the form
            of acetyl coenzyme a starting from the
            carboxyl end of the fatty acyl chain
            okay so this involves a
            separation of two carbon units from a
            fatty acid chain in the form of acetyl
            coenzyme and the whole process starts
            from the carboxyl end of the fatty acid
            gene okay so this is how this is what is
            actually basic uh crux of beta oxidation
            are fatty acids but as already mentioned
            fatty acid is present in the cytoplasm
            and it has to be transported to the
            mitochondria for uh
            taking up the beet oxidation proper
            proper isn't it so the uh as such the
            process takes place in three stages it
            has to be fatty acid acid it cannot be
            transported into the mitochondrial
            matrix the fatty acids of chain length
            uh 12 or fewer or lesser it can enter
            the mitochondria without any help it can
            just pass through the membrane and it
            can reach the mitochondrial matrix it
            doesn't need any mitochondrial
            transporter but those fatty acid chains
            which are which contain
            14 or more carbon atoms they cannot pass
            the mitochondrial membrane as such
            without the help of any transporter
            molecules and these uh
            the free fatty acids which are produced
            as a result of the lipid uh hydro
            breakdown they are mostly of
            14 or more
            fatty acids with more
            more than uh 14 carbon atoms okay so
            they need to end
            transported from the
            cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix
            and for this transport they need
            special transporter molecules carnitine
            transporter molecules okay so this is
            how the three stages have been
            recognized uh because the carnotin it
            cannot take up direct directly the fatty
            acid molecules it has to be get
            activated so those fatty acids which are
            to be transported and which have to
            enter the beta oxidation proper it has
            to get activated okay and this takes
            place inside the cytoplasm so here the
            step it shows the activation of fatty
            acids the fatty acid it gets converted
            into fatty acyl for enzyme a and that is
            what is referred as the activation and
            it occurs in the cytoplasm okay and this
            activated fatty acid it is getting
            transported into mitochondria through
            carnatine shuttle that is the second
            stage and once it reaches the
            mitochondrial matrix the exact beta
            oxidation proper it takes place in the
            mitochondrial matrix with the help of
            the enzymes present in there okay
            there'll be dark station so these three
            stages activation of fatty acid
            transport of fatty acid through the
            carnitine shuttle shuttle and then the
            beta oxidation proper so this
            we will be discussing the beta oxidation
            in under these three steps the first is
            activation of fatty acid
            so as already mentioned uh activation of
            fatty acid involves conversion of fatty
            acid into fatty acyl coenzyme and the
            whole process it is catalyzed by fatty
            acid coenzyme a synthetase or it is
            otherwise known as thiokinese okay and
            uh it also require uh
            the what you call the atp the presence
            of atp okay now what happens during this
            the whole um activation of fatty acid it
            takes place in two and the two steps
            okay the first one over here you can see
            uh the
            this is this requires atp right so here
            you can see the atp and this is the
            fatty acid right so during this process
            what happens is the carboxylate ion that
            is over here the co minus it gets
            adenylated by atp okay you can see what
            happens over here okay so this is the
            fatty acid right and this is the uh
            monophosphate okay adenosine
            monophosphate okay so and during this
            process what happens the pyrophosphate
            is released there's a break over here
            right and uh it is released as
            pyrophosphate okay so if we get the the
            carboxylate unit it gets annihilated to
            form fatty acid adenylate and during
            this process pyrophosphate is released
            and the spirophosphate it is immediately
            hydrolyzed to produce two inorganic
            phosphates okay now what happens to fat
            tsl adenylate it is a
            adhyrate molecule okay and this it gets
            uh uh like uh uh uh con i mean um acted
            upon by co-enzyme okay fatty acid acne
            it gets acted upon by coenzyme
            okay and it then gets converted into
            fatty acyl coenzyme
            and again the same uh enzyme is uh
            actually
            uh catalyzing the
            this reverse process as well okay so
            here you can see the second step
            involves the thiol group of uh what you
            call the coenzyme a that is su a
            attacks the acyl adenylate acyle
            annihilating this is fatty acidity the
            whole molecule
            displacing adenosine monophosphate and
            forming a thioester fatty sl coenzyme
            okay so this is a thyristor molecule and
            the specifically the fatty acid enzyme i
            hope it is clear okay so here what
            happens fatty acid it gets a fatty acid
            it is getting reacted with atp during
            this process we get an intermediate
            fatty acid adenylate which gets acted
            upon by the coenzyme a and during this
            process we get a uh fatty acyl coenzyme
            and during the whole process atp it gets
            converted to atp sorry amp and two
            inorganic phosphates are being produced
            uh as a result so the net reaction we
            can say the fatty acid gives
            fatty acyl coenzyme during the process a
            coenzyme a molecule is being utilized at
            the same time atp is getting converted
            to eight amp and and then two inorganic
            phosphates are produced the whole
            process is catalyzed by thiokinese
            enzyme or fatty acid coenzyme a
            synthetase enzyme the next step is
            carnitine shuttle okay this is very
            important in the sense the fatty acid
            acyl coenzyme a which is being produced
            in the cytoplasm have to be transported
            to the mitochondrial matrix okay
