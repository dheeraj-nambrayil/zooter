            hello everyone welcome to a new session
            on biochemistry
            uh here we are going to deal with a
            metabolic
            pathway that is a krebs cycle uh the
            Krebs Cycle
            krebs cycle it is otherwise referred as
            citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid
            cycle
            in the 19th century biologists they
            observed
            that in the absence of oxygen that is an
            anaerobic condition
            the cells produce either lactic acid or
            ethanol it is lactic acid and skeletal
            muscles and in
            yeast we can see ethanol being produced
            but in the presence of
            oxygen that is in aerobic condition uh
            the cells produce carbon dioxide and
            water
            uh with the consumption of oxygen so
            efforts were made
            to study the pathway of these aerobic
            metabolism
            and this led to the discovery of the
            citric acid cycle or the krebs cycle
            the studies were conducted mainly by
            hans scripps
            and the krebs cycle was elucidated in
            the year
            uh it completed in the year 1937
            based on the studies of oxygen
            consumption in the pigeon breast muscle
            and for this study hans scripps was
            awarded the nobel prize in physiology
            and medicine
            in the year 1953. um
            we can see that this citric acid cycle
            it accounts for
            about two-thirds of the total oxidation
            of carbon compounds
            uh it is a final common oxidative
            pathway for carbohydrates fats
            and amino acids and hence almost like
            about
            two-thirds of the total oxidation of
            carbon compounds
            in most of the cells happens by citric
            acid cycle
            ah and we can see that the major
            antioxidant is carbon dioxide
            as well as uh high energy electrons
            which are produced in the form of nadh
            so carbon dioxide and high energy
            electrons are the end products in the
            case of
            krebs cycle the carbon dioxide is being
            expelled
            out from the cell and from the organism
            as a waste product while
            the electrons which are produced the
            high energy electrons which are produced
            they are directed into the next phase of
            the aerobic metabolism and that is the
            electron transport chain system okay so
            these
            uh this is what happens in the krebs
            cycle so here you can see
            the this is the krebs cycle of the
            citric acid cycle
            and the end products they are the carbon
            dioxide
            and electrons and these electrons then
            pass
            into the electron transport system in
            the mitochondria
            so it is these electrons are fine
            are finally combined with oxygen
            and water is just being produced so as
            such
            the aerobic metabolism the antibiotics
            are
            carbon dioxide and water okay uh
            the location so where it happens the
            citric acid cycle
            it takes place inside the mitochondria
            in eukaryotic cells
            and it results in the complete oxidation
            of carbon atoms present in the acetyl
            group
            in acetyl coenzyme a converting them to
            carbon dioxide
            so the first thing we need to know is
            how the acetyl coenzyme is produced
            because the krebs cycle the first
            substrate to enter it is the acetal
            coenzyme
            now acetyl coenzyme a it includes a
            series of oxidation reduction reactions
            that result in the oxidation of complete
            oxidation of
            the acetyl group present as acetyl
            coenzyme
            to form two molecules of carbon dioxide
            and this oxidation it generates high
            energy electrons in the form of
            what you call nadh and these electrons
            are then
            passed on into the electron transport
            chain system
            where these electrons are being used for
            the synthesis of
            atp so what is the major function of
            citric acid cycle it is a harvesting of
            high energy electrons from the carbon
            fuels i hope it is clear
            Cellular Metabolism
            okay now when you speak about the
            cellular metabolism there are three
            stages of cellular metabolism
            the first and foremost is actually we
            can say it is four because the first one
            it is actually the digestion of major
            bio molecules like lipids proteins
            and carbohydrates to form the
            respective uh like
            products okay digestive products like
            lipids giving rise to fatty acids and
            glycerol
            uh carbohydrates breaking down finally
            to form glucose
            or allied molecules proteins getting
            broken down into
            amino acids okay all these three
            the formation of these three can be
            considered as a stage one in the whole
            process of
            cellular respiration these three enter
            the cytoplasm
            okay uh now the next stage we can say it
            is the acetyl coenzyme production
            uh fatty acids they undergo a beta
            oxidation to produce acetyl coenzyme
            so it as such acetyl coenzyme is pre
            produced directly from by the process of
            beta oxidation now glucose
            it undergoes glycolysis to produce
            pyruvate
            or the pyruvic acid and this pyruvic
            acid it undergo
            oxidative decarboxylation that is
            oxalation and
            decarboxylation to produce acetyl
            coenzyme
            so glycolysis the glucose to pyruvate
            conversion through the glycolytic
            pathway we have already seen in one of
            the previous presentation
            and uh the next we have to see is how
            pyruvate
            it undergoes the oxidative
            recarboxylation to produce acetyl
            coenzyme
            uh the next one is substrate it is an
            Substrate
            amino acid
            amino acids uh yeah so this is all about
            the amino acids which give rise to
            acetyl coenzyme or any other product
            related to
            the citric acid cycle so here you can
            see
            uh amino acids like ln glycine 309
            cysteine serine tryptophan
            they get broken down to produce pyruvate
            or they get
            actually converted to
            pyruvate and the spiderweight can enter
            the um
            what you call citric acid cycle by its
            conversion to acetyl coenzyme
            and then its entry into the the
            tricarboxylic acid cycle
            okay uh then another is like tryptophan
            tyrosine phenylalanine threonine
            isoleucine lysine and lucy uh these
            amino acids they get
            degraded to form acetyl coenzyme okay
            so these amino acids which can get
            converted into
            acetyl coenzyme a they are known as
            ketogenic amino acids
            why because the acetyl coenzyme a can
            uh even acetyl acetic acid and acetyl
            coenzyme
            they can be used for the synthesis of
            fatty acids okay
            so these are known as ketogenic amino
            acids and these ketogenic amino acids it
            gets converted to acetyl coenzyme
            this acetylcholine can enter the citric
            acid cycle
            okay so these two are the ones which uh
            produce acetyl coenzyme
            now we have the different glucogenic
            amino acids you can see over here these
            are known as
            glucogenic amino acids which will get
            converted
            to uh various
            intermediate substrates of the citric
            acid cycle
            for instance we can start over here
            arginine proline histidine
            glutamine it gets metabolically
            converted to glutamate
            which gets degraded to alpha
            ketoglutarate which is an intermediary
            product of citric acid cycle okay
            threonine methionine isoleucine and
            valine
            they get converted to succinal coenzyme
            tyrosine phenylalanine aspartate they
            will get converted to fumarate
            and aspartate and asparagine they will
            get converted to oxaloacetate so
            all these are intermediary products okay
            so all these amino acids are generally
            referred as glucogenic amino acids
            because they give rise to the uh what
            you call
            intermediary products of the tca cycle
            okay so this is about the amino acids
            how they enter the
            um citric acid cycle now we can see that
            um the acetyl coenzyme okay we are
            speaking about the acetyl coenzyme
            or production okay acetyl coenzyme
            production acetyl coenzyme
            it actually plays a very important role
            in the intermediary metabolism and you
            can see
            it closely integrates the catabolism of
            sugars the fatty acids as well as the
            amino acids
            and it can be considered as occupying
            a position at the junction uh between
            the catabolic pathways of
            all these three biomolecules okay and
            all these uh the catabolic pathways of
            all these three biomolecules it will
            merge at this particular junction that
            is acetyl coenzyme
            right now we will see how uh pi the
            pyruvic acid it is getting converted to
            acetyl coenzyme and that is considered
            to be the first
            step into the entry of the
            entry into the citric acid cycle okay so
            we are going to speak about the
            uh acetyl coenzyme production from
            pyruvate specifically
            okay and later we will see acetyl
            coenzyme oxidation that takes place in
            the citric acid cycle proper
            and then the vertical electrons
            produced high energy electrons produced
            in the form of nadh and fadh2 how they
            enter the oxidative phosphorylation the
            electron transfer and oxidative
            phosphorylation
            that that will result in the formation
            of atp or synthesis of atp
            and all these takes place inside the
            mitochondria these takes place in the
            cytoplasm
            the formation and then once it gets
            converted into acetyl coenzyme
            it acetal coenzyme a it is produced
            inside the mitochondria
            from the pyruvic acid and many other
            like pyruvic acid fatty acids and even
            ketogenic
            amino acids okay so this acetyl coenzyme
            it is produced
            inside the mitochondria and
