            hello everyone welcome to the new
            session on biochemistry where we are
            going to deal with the krebs cycle
            proper okay the krebs cycle uh it is
            otherwise known as citric acid or
            tricarboxylic acid cycle it is a cycle
            of aerobic reactions by which the acetyl
            coenzyme a the energy rich acetyl
            coenzyme a it is oxidized to yield
            carbon dioxide
            water
            atp and energized
            hydrogen atoms or even we can say
            electrons okay so here hydrogen atoms
            are trapped in the form of nadh
            or we can say fadh2 right and these the
            electrons are then being pumped into the
            electron transport chain
            okay which
            is later used for the synthesis of atp
            the krebs cycle
            it occurs in mitochondrial matrix
            except for one step over here
            the succinic acid to uh sorry what you
            call the uh succinic acid to fumaric
            acid over here succiny succinate
            dehydrogenase except for this enzyme all
            the enzymes of the citric acid cycle it
            is present in mitochondrial matrix okay
            ah succiny dehydrogenase on the other
            hand it is present on the inner
            mitochondrial membrane okay it is a part
            of the
            uh what you call integral membrane or
            integral uh
            membrane protein of the mitochondrial in
            in a mitochondrial membrane okay now in
            carbohydrate metabolism krebs cycle
            immediately follows the glycolysis while
            in the um lipid metabolism we can say
            the citric the citric acid cycle it
            follows the beta oxidation of fatty
            acids okay now
            so this is about the basic things about
            the tca cycle or the tricarboxylic acid
            cycle now when you start with the
            tricarboxylic acid cycle it is actually
            the acetyl coenzyme a coming into play
            okay so acetyl coenzyme a
            uh is produced from pyruvate
            uh by
            oxidative recarboxylation process which
            is catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate
            dehydrogenase
            complex okay now the acetyl coenzyme is
            combines with a condenses with
            oxaloacetate to produce citric acid and
            that is the first step in the whole
            cyclic process
            and the citric acid produced so two
            carbon acetyl coenzyme combines or
            condenses with four carbonyl cellular
            acetic acid resulting in the formation
            of six carbon citric acid and the citric
            acid it gets uh get isomerized to form
            isocitric acid ah which undergoes
            oxidative decarboxylation
            uh
            to produce
            alpha ketoglutaric acid right and the
            alpha to glutaric acid it is uh it
            undergoes another set of oxidative
            carboxylation to produce the
            uh
            succinic acid over here okay
            these two steps that is isocitric acid
            to alpha ketoglutaric acid and alpha
            ketoglutaric acid to succinic acid these
            two steps do have a transient
            intermediate uh isocitrate while it is
            getting oxidative deca undergoing
            oxidative decarboxylation to form alpha
            ketoglutaric acid an intermediate
            product of oxaloacetic acid is produced
            it is a very transient uh intermediate
            substrate which readily gets undergoes
            transformation into alpha ketoglutaric
            acid now
            isocitrate this is six carbon uh
            compound while uh because of
            decarboxylation alpha ketoglutarate
            produced it will be only five carbon uh
            compound okay and this five carbon alpha
            ketoglutarate it undergoes another set
            of decarboxylation uh to produce a
            succinct four carbon succinal coenzyme
            right four carbon compound and ah
            this again uh
            suctional coenzyme is again an uh
            transient intermediary product so it
            will produce succinct acid later the
            succinic acid it will produce
            oxaloacetic acid through fumaric acid
            and malic acid okay so oxaloacetate is
            regenerated while the acetyl com
            part of the acetyl coenzyme it is
            getting completely converted into carbon
            dioxide so each turn of krebs cycle
            actually takes up oxaloacetate and one
            acetyl group of acetyl coenzyme
            and releases uh two carbon dioxide one
            over here and another over here two
            carbon dioxide and eight pairs of
            hydrogen
            right that is it is equivalent to eight
            uh electron pairs okay and oxaloacetate
            is regenerated at the end of the cycle
            which can be utilized for another cycle
            okay the next cycle while acetyl group
            is completely uh
            like degraded to carbon dioxide and the
            molecules like okay so there is no ah
            oxaloacetate is every time being uh
            regenerated to be used again
            now
            step by step we can see
            so the first step is uh the condensation
            of acetyl-coa enzyme a with oxaloacetic
            acid to produce the citric acid right uh
            here what happens is the first molecule
            it is a two carbon you can see one two
            okay this do have a coin enzyme and here
            you can see the first
            compound the two carbon acetyl coenzyme
            a it condenses with the oxaloacetate
            to be specific during this reaction what
            happens is the acetyl group of acetyl
            coenzyme a
            it condenses with the carbonyl a group
            of oxaloacetic acid to produce acetonyl
            coenzyme which is an intermediate which
            uh readily undergoes hydrolysis you can
            see water is added which uh readily
            undergo
            hydrolysis to produce citric acid and
            coenzyme i'll repeat the acetyl group of
            acetyl coenzyme will condense with the
            carbonyl group of acid oxaloacetic acid
            to produce a citronyl coenzyme which is
            a very transient intermediary product
            which undergoes hydration or which
            undergo hydrolysis
            to result in the formation of citric
            acid and coenzyme okay and the whole
            process the condensation it is being uh
            catalyzed by citrate synthase or citric
            acid
            synthase or it is otherwise
            even referred as citrate synthetes okay
            i hope it is visible citrate synthase
            okay uh now here you can see the
            coenzyme a is free and this coenzyme a
            which is being liberated over here it
            can uh be used up during the uh
            oxidative decarboxylation of another
            pyruvic acid molecule okay to produce
            acetyl coenzyme a once again so here it
            doesn't be getting released now the next
            is we have is a citric acid citric acid
            to um
            the next one we have is isocitrate it's
            a isomerization process but during this
            it is not a single step it is a two-step
            process okay that is a um
            like uh formation of isocitrate from the
            citrate so citric acid first it
            undergoes uh isomerization and then an
            asymmetric dehydration so here you can
            see it undergoes dehydration water is
            released right so uh what happens is
            uh it will get uh
            like uh uh produce cis a carnetic acid
            okay so it loses one molecule of water
            citric acid it loses one molecule of
            water uh results in the formation of cis
            a carnitic acid and this uh a causes a
            carnitic acid it undergoes stereo
            specific hydration water is added okay
            so uh stereo specific hydration and
            results in the formation of isocitrate
            and both these reactions are catalyzed
            by the same enzyme economies
            okay ah
            so here it is actually a uh dehydration
            and later rehydration process that is
            what results in the formation of
            isocitrate from the citrate okay now
            that uh what happens to isocitrate uh
            you can see the isocitrate it will uh
            undergo oxidative decarboxylation okay
            oxidative decarboxylation to produce
            alpha ketoglutaric acid uh again this is
            not a single step
            the it is a two step process where in
            the first step isocitric acid uh it will
            undergo dehydrogenation that is
            oxidation uh to result in the formation
            of oxaloacetic acid okay here we don't
            have the oxalosuccinic acid again here
            also it's oxalocenic acid and this
            oxaloacetic acid it will uh
            later undergo
            decarboxylation to yield the alpha
            ketoglutaric acid okay so first it is a
            isocitrate to alpha ketoglutarate it is
            a oxidative decarboxylation process it
            is a two-step process firstly the
            isocitrate it will undergo oxidation or
            dehydrogenation to produce oxalosinic
            acid and the oxalosuccinic acid it will
            later undergo
            decarboxylation process to result in the
            formation of alpha ketoglutaric acid
            okay so this is a two-step process now
            the enzyme which uh catalyzes the
            reaction isocitrate to oxaloactinic acid
            the conversion is or the
            oxidation it is being catalyzed by
            isocitrate dehydrogenase
            okay and uh here the hydrogen which is
            released from here the isocitrate it is
            received by nad okay nad plus
            and it results in the formation of nadh
            you can see here nadh is being released
            from the step okay because first step it
            is oxidative oxidation that is hydrogen
            is released and this hydrogen is taken
            up by the nad plus where nad plus get
            reduced from the nadh okay and while i
            the isocitrate it will get oxidized to
            form the ah oxalosinic acid the second
            step so the enzyme is isocitrate
            dehydrogenase okay isocitrate is getting
            dehydrogenated with the help of this
            enzyme the second step is
            decarboxylation
            Decarboxylation
            the oxaloactinic acid undergoing
            decarboxylation and uh this particular
            reaction is uh like uh catalyzed by
            oxalosuccinate
            decarboxylase i hope the name you can
            very well relate with because uh carbo
            carbon dioxide is getting uh released
            isn't it a decarboxylation process and
            the carboxylation takes place what is
            the substrate oxalosuccinate okay so it
            is oxalocenate decarboxylase enzyme uh
            it catalyzes the the carboxylation of
            oxaloacetic acid to alpha ketoglutaric
            acid i hope that part is clear the next
            step is alpha ketoglutaric acid to
            succinic acid again this is also a
            two-step process uh this is yet another
            uh what you call oxidative
            decarboxylation process okay so here the
            first step is oxidative decarboxylation
            process here oxidation is taking place
            as well as decarboxylation process is
            taking place okay now uh the alpha
            ketoglutaric acid is a
            yeah five uh carbon uh compound and it
            undergoes uh oxidative decarboxylation
            to produce four carbon succinyl coenzyme
            here uh
            this uh particular reaction it is
            catalyzed by alpha-ketoglutarate
            dehydrogenase complex okay it is not a
            single enzyme it is a complex enzyme and
            here alpha ketoglutarate acid ah carbon
            dioxide is released the same time it
            undergoes oxidation the hydrogen
            released is taken by nad plus which is
            get reduced to produce nadh this is a
            second nadh molecule being produced in
            the citric acid cycle okay so the
            oxidation of alpha ketoglutaridic acid
            it uh it is again uh
            Oxidation
            irreversible you can see here it is
            irreversible all these were reversible
            right these two are irreversible uh
            reactions okay and the nadh it is being
            released one molecule of nadh is
            produced now what happens to the next
            step six null coenzyme a to the saxonic
            acid ah succinal coenzyme is a highly
            unstable uh
            but energy rich compound and uh this
            what happens is
            at this particular stage that is
            succinyl coenzyme to succinic acid it is
            a substrate level uh phosphorylation
            step okay
            it is not atp dependent but it is gtp is
            the molecule which is being produced but
            again it is a substrate level
            phosphorylation and here what happens is
            succinyl coenzyme a it reacts with gdp
            and inorganic phosphate to produce gtp
            and succinic acid i hope it is clear
            okay succinyl coenzyme reacts with gdp
            and inorganic phosphate to produce gtp
            and succinic acid it is a substrate
            level phosphorylation process okay now
            this particular reaction is uh catalyzed
            by succinyl coenzyme a synthetase or it
            is also known as succinic acid thiokines
            okay i hope this one will be better okay
            succinal coenzyme a synthetase now this
            what happens to the gtp produce the gtp
            produced it will be utilized for the
            phosphorylation of adp and atp will be
            produced so it is actually atp
            generating step itself okay uh and this
            atg what you call gtp dependent atp
            synthesis it is being catalyzed by the
            enzyme nucleoside diphospho kinase okay
            adp is getting converted to atp during
            the process while gtp goes back to gdp
            state okay now next step the succinc so
            succinic acid is ready now we will go to
            the next step the succinic acid it
            undergoes dehydrogenation okay that is
            it undergoes oxidation process and since
            succinate is the uh substrate the enzyme
            which catalyzes the dehydrogenation to
            succinate dehydrogenase okay it will
            result in the formation of humarate what
            happens to the hydrogen the hydrogen
            release it is taken up by the fad
            molecule and fadh2 it is being produced
            okay and this fadh2 will enter the
            electron transport chain along with the
            nadh molecules produced during the cycle
            okay so succinic acid it undergoes
            oxidation or dehydrogenation transforms
            into fumaric acid and uh the enzyme
            which catalyzes it is succinate uh
            succinic acid dehydrogenase okay and
            during this process fadh2 is being
            produced okay now saxonic as already
            mentioned succinic acid dehydrogenase is
            membrane-bound enzyme
            present on the inner mitochondrial
            membrane of the
            eukaryotes okay now what happens to
            fumaric acid fumaric acid again it
            undergoes a reversible reaction it
            undergoes hydration stereo specific
            hydration results in the formation of
            malate okay right
