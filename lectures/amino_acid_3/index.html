            hello everyone welcome to
            the session on metabolism we'll be
            continuing with the oxidation of amino
            acids
            which is part of the metabolism of amino
            acids the first
            type which we in detail looked into was
            the deamination the oxidative
            deamination and hydraulic deamination
            this next we have is transamination
            trans deamination and decarboxylation
            okay
            so first we'll see transamination
            transamination it is a reversible
            uh transfer of alpha amino group
            from an amino acid to a keto acid
            okay this keto acid where how it is
            formed it is formed by
            deamination of another amino acid okay
            so they are all
            uh like reversible process now here you
            can see it is it involves
            interconversion of a pair of amino acids
            and a pair of keto acids
            what does it mean here we can start with
            this amino acid okay
            this amino acid area and this keto acid
            it
            these two substrates are undergoing
            transamination
            during which the amino group from this
            amino acid it will get transported to
            the keto acid
            as a result of which what will happen is
            this amino acid it will become
            its corresponding keto acid and the keto
            acid which receive the amino group will
            get converted into the corresponding
            amino acid okay
            so there is a pair of amino acid and
            keto acid
            uh which when undergo under
            when they undergo the transamination it
            will result in
            another pair of keto acid and amino acid
            okay the whole process the whole
            reaction it is catalyzed by
            transaminases or it is otherwise known
            as amino transferases
            and this enzyme it required
            the presence of coenzyme periodoxyl
            phosphate
            okay now uh here you can see it is both
            uh deamination with respect to this
            amino acid
            and amination with respect to this keto
            acid
            okay so it is a combined deamination and
            amination process which results in
            transamination
            transamination it is very uh important
            with respect to the interconversion of
            an amino acid
            in metabolic processes okay as already
            mentioned uh
            it it occurs with the help of amino acid
            specific transaminases
            that is for each set of amino acid keto
            acid there is a
            transaminases okay now it occurs in
            all amino acids that process except for
            lysine 309
            proline and hydroxyproline okay and
            uh here there is no removal of ammonia
            that is ammonia free ammonia is not
            liberated okay now uh the
            Silent Features
            if you look into the silent features of
            transformation
            we can see that the transamination has
            already mentioned it is a reversible
            process
            it brings about the interconversion of
            amino acids
            in metabolic processes it also channels
            the excess amino acids to energy
            generation
            for example when there are excessive
            amino acids it can be used for the
            synthesis
            of certain uh products like ketoglutaric
            acid or pyruvic acid or oxaloacetic acid
            etc
            and these can then take part in the
            krebs cycle and later be used for the
            synthesis of atp
            so in such way the transformation
            process it can channel the excess amino
            acids to generate energy
            the transamination does not involve the
            release of
            free ammonia it only involves inter
            molecular transfer of amino group
            and most as already mentioned the lysine
            except for lysine proline 309
            hydroxyproline
            all amino acids take part in
            transamination process
            and the most commonest
            amino group acceptors they are alpha
            keto glutaric acid
            or ketoglutarate which when receives
            amino group becomes glutamate okay
            then pyruvic acid which when receives
            amino group
            it will become ln oxaloacetate it is the
            keto acid of aspartic acid
            okay so these are the major amino group
            acceptors
            so transfer of amino group to these
            acceptors will result in the formation
            of the
            amino acids which are given in the
            brackets okay now
            uh you can see here these are two
            major examples okay the amino group of
            alanine and aspartic acid
            it may get transferred to alpha
            ketoglutaric acid
            and results in the formation of these
            two okay so aspartate
            is amino acid and this is the keto acid
            ketoglutarate
            so this is the acceptor so amino group
            from aspartic acid it gets transferred
            to alpha ketoglutaric acid
            it will result in the formation of
            oxaloacetic acid which is a keto acid
            and glutamate which is the amino acid of
            the ketoglutarate okay here also you can
            see lni it gets kind of
            uh like deaminated to produce pyruvic
            acid while
            alpha ketoglutarate becomes aminated to
            become glutamate
            these two are being the reactions are
            catalyzed by
            aspartate amino transferase and
            amino transferase enzyme okay the
            transamination is a reversible reaction
            which is catalyzed by the
            amino transferases or transaminases
            and these enzymes it is present in liver
            pancreas kidney heart and drain
            and you can see the transformation
            process occurring in all these
            uh organs okay ah
            Transformation
            now you can see here this is the
            transamination okay the substrate
            amino acid okay the the this is a step
            this is a figure which shows the steps
            involved in transamination process okay
            now here we have a substrate amino acid
            and a substrate keto acid
            okay these two are the ones which ah
            which is which are going into plane
            right this is the one the substrate
            amino acid and substrate keto acid
            now how does it happen okay uh the
            transamination it involves two steps
            right first one it is um transfer of
            amino group from the donor
            amino acid this is the donor amino acid
            okay transfer of amino group from the
            donor amino acid
            to p redux p sorry periodoxyl phosphate
            which is the
            coenzyme okay so the amino group get get
            transferred to periodoxyl
            phosphate so this amino acid it undergo
            deamination as a result it will turn
            into keto acid
            okay when the amino group get
            transferred to dixon phosphate
            it will become periodoxamine phosphate
            okay so first the donor amino acid it
            undergo deamination to produce
            keto acid and the amino group released
            it is taken up by the periodoxyl
            phosphate
            this we did oxal phosphate as a result
            of amination it becomes pyridoxamine
            phosphate
            okay now the second step is so what now
            what we have is pyridoxamine phosphate
            okay now second step is transfer of this
            amino group
            from the paradox mean phosphate to keto
            acid it is amino acid
            the acceptability the keto acid okay so
            this amino group it will get transferred
            to the keto acid what will happen
            it will become the product amino acid a
            new amino acid
            and during this process what happens the
            keto acid will turn into
            amino acid it releases periodoxyl
            phosphate free
            now what all are the free compounds now
            we have the
            product keto acid and product amino acid
            with periodoxyl phosphate
            free i hope this is clear okay now next
            Transdeamination
            is
            transdeamination trans deamination it is
            a couple reaction in which
            transamination it is followed by
            oxidative deamination okay and this is a
            major route of amino acid deamination
            the
            uh net conversion of alpha amino group
            to ammonia
            it requires the action of glutamine
            trans uh transaminase and glutamate
            dehydrogenase
            so glutamate transaminase is involved in
            the transamination process and glutamate
            dehydrogenase is involved in the
            oxidative reamination process
            okay and the reaction uh
            occurs in both liver and kidney in the
            mitochondria as well as in the
            cytoplasmic part
            atp and gtp are the elastic inhibitors
            while adp and gdp activate the enzyme
            okay now it is a reversible reaction as
            already mentioned
            ah and it usually functions in amino
            acid catabolism
            and amino acid anabolism okay these two
            uh processes you can see that
            transdiamination occurring
            in amino acid uh catabolism that is
            cutting down
            actually uh the transmits nitrogen from
            glutamate to urea
            in urea cycle so glutamate the amino
            acid is being cleaved to produce
            release the ammonia so that it can be
            used for the urea
            synthesis in anabolism what happens
            amination of
            ketoglutaric acid it is a keto acid and
            as a result what happens
            amination it will result in the
            formation of glutamate okay so it is a
            trans deamination process
            so it involves catabolism where trans uh
            deamination is taking place
            okay and then followed by this one okay
            Transformation Transdeamination
            so this is a step we can see
            so transformation trans deamination
            occurs in two steps
            first step is transamination here you
            can see
            the transfer of amino group one and for
            amino acid
            to a keto acid okay alpha amino
            whatever happens is there is a uh amino
            acid and a ketoacid involved in the
            reaction
            okay amino group from alpha amino acid
            will get transferred to keto acid
            what happens as a result the ketoacid
            will become an amino acid
            what happens to the amino acid it will
            be converted to the
            keto acid okay and the whole reaction is
            catalyzed by transaminase enzyme
            so new amino acid and a keto acid are
            being produced
            but here there is no involvement of
            ammonia okay now second step is
            oxidative deamination here over here
            this is the second step
            okay here this undergoes oxidative um
            oxidation that is nad to nadh2 and
            deamination
            here ammonia is released
