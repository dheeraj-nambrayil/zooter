            hello everyone welcome to a new session
            in biochemistry
            this presentation brings to you the
            detailed account
            of the metabolic process glycolysis
            What is Glycolysis
            the glycolysis the term comes from two
            greek terms
            the greek root words which means sugar
            or splitting okay sugar and splitting
            which means glycolysis in nutshell it is
            the
            breakdown or the splitting or the
            dissolution of
            the sugar molecule it could be glucose
            mainly it is glucose
            okay so that is glycolysis so it can be
            defined as
            sequence of reactions that metabolizes
            one molecule of glucose
            to produce two molecules of spiderweight
            along with production of atp
            so uh the glucose molecule a single
            glucose molecule
            it is broken down to produce two
            molecules of pyruvic acid
            and along with that energy is produced
            in the form of
            atp molecules okay what are the
            significant features of
            what you call glycolysis you can say
            that glycolysis
            it occurs in all the cells of the body
            and enzymes of enzymes required for the
            glycolytic pathway
            it is present in the cytoplasm of all
            the cells
            okay and it is considered to be the sole
            source of
            what you call energy in many of the
            mammalian tissues and cell types for
            example
            glycolysis it is a major pathway for the
            synthesis of energy for the
            atp synthesis in tissues which lack
            mitochondria
            for example erythrocytes then
            what you call cornea lens etc and other
            than that
            it is also the souls of souls of energy
            in many
            um tissues like renal medulla
            of that of a brain sperm etc so
            glycolysis is very essential for brain
            which is depend upon uh glucose for
            energy
            and uh the as already mentioned the
            glucose is the sole source of energy
            in the brain and uh the like it depends
            upon glycolysis for the complete
            uh energy purpose and along with that
            many anaerobic microorganisms they are
            entirely dependent on
            a glucose because glycolysis is a
            anaerobic process
            it doesn't require oxygen so it can
            take place in the absence or
            Where does Glycolysis take place
            in the presence of oxygen
            in the presence of oxygen that is in
            aerobic condition what happens is
            the glucose it breaks down to pyruvate
            and this pyruvate later
            it can ah get oxidized to carbon dioxide
            and water
            but in the absence of oxygen the um
            like the glucose it will break down to
            pyruvate which will enter the anaerobic
            pathway
            and result in the production of lactate
            uh under anaerobic condition okay so
            whichever will be the way
            it we can see that uh it does it occurs
            in the absence as well as in the
            presence of oxygen
            okay so that is more important thing
            because there are plenty of organisms
            which
            come completely depend on the glycolytic
            pathway for their energy
            uh needs okay it is because glycolysis
            can very well
            uh get completed in the absence of
            oxygen
            now uh we can see that uh the
            the glycolytic pathway it was
            illustrated uh
            or the complete uh pathway of glycolysis
            was elucidated by 1940
            and um endon and miroff they were two by
            chemists
            who had contributed uh to the knowledge
            of
            glycolysis um especially the enzymatic
            uh breakdown at various stages of
            glycolysis we completely studied
            and elucidated by emden and meirav and
            in honor of these two uh vacuums
            the glycolysis is also known as emden
            mayor of pathway
            okay so the this is about the glycolysis
            the interaction okay that is glycolysis
            it involves sequence of reactions that
            will convert
            or break down glucose into two molecules
            a single
            molecule of glucose into two molecules
            of uh pyruvic acid along with the
            production of atp
            okay and there are uh glycolysis is uh
            unique because it can happen in both uh
            presence or absence of oxygen
            in the presence of oxygen the glucose
            molecule it will be
            broken down into two molecules of
            pyruvate pyruvic acid
            and uh under the in the absence of
            oxygen this
            pyruvic acid it can get converted into
            lactic acid
            okay uh in the uh um
            or even what you call uh alcoholic
            fermentation is that uh in
            east and uh so uh in the presence of
            oxygen what happens the pyruvate it is
            getting oxidized to form carbon dioxide
            water
            right so it can happen in both
            situations that are so
            many cells which can which are
            anaerobically functioning they do depend
            on glycolysis for their
            energy date secondly we can see that
            there are many cells which
            uh lack mitochondria they are they may
            be aerobic but they lack mitochondria
            so they have to depend upon glycolysis
            for their
            complete source of energy okay so that
            is about the glycolysis
            Steps in Glycolysis
            now regarding the um steps involved
            glycolysis the whole complete sequence
            of reactions it can be
            divided into two phases that is
            preparatory phase or the priming phase
            we call
            uh and the payoff phase okay the first
            phase is a preparatory phase
            and uh the first set of phases and the
            preparatory phase or the first phase of
            glycolysis
            it is referred as priming phase or it is
            known as energizing phase
            okay priming phase in the sense the
            phase where the energy is being utilized
            okay energy is being utilized in the
            form of atp right
            and during this particular phase we can
            see that the glucose
            it gets uh phosphorylated uh
            and then it splits into two uh
            the triose phosphate molecules okay so
            it is actually
            uh glucose produ uh converted into
            glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate
            and this process it gets
            included under preparatory phase and uh
            the glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate is a
            three carbon
            containing compound or three carbon
            containing sugar while glucose is a six
            carbon containing sugar
            so a six carbon sugar is uh converted
            into
            three carbon phosphorylated sugar okay
            this is what happens in the preparatory
            phase
            and here you can see a
            non-phosphorylated sugar is getting
            converted into phosphorylated sugar
            obviously there is a requirement of
            atp okay so that is where the atp is
            getting you
            utilized and energy is uh like used
            okay so it is actually glucose is
            getting activated
            or it is getting primed we call or it is
            getting prepared for the
            glycolytic process okay the second phase
            uh actually it is known as the
            payoff phase or we call it as uh energy
            uh what you call um it
            is actually atp is produced during this
            phase okay it is energy conserving phase
            okay or conservation phase okay
            so here what happens is the free energy
            which is trapped in the substrate
            molecules
            uh it is the free energy it is getting
            trapped in the substrate molecules and
            this
            is getting con conserved in the form of
            atp okay
            here the glyceraldehyde three phosphate
            it is getting converted into
            the pyruvic acid okay ultimately passing
            through various tips
            pyruvic acid is produced and during the
            this particular phase
            nadh in atp molecules are produced
            uh which is actually energy conserving
            molecules
            okay so glycolysis it is for um the
            whole set of reactions it can be
            uh differentiated into two phases
            preparatory phase and p
            of phase preparatory phase is otherwise
            known as priming phase or energy
            spending phase okay it is actually
            energy requiring phase
            here what happens is the glucose uh
            molecule is getting prepared
            or activated to undergo the glycolytic
            pathway
            okay and in the preparatory phase
            glucose which is a six carbon sugar is
            getting converted into
            phosphorylated three carbon sugar which
            is this glyceraldehyde three phosphate
            okay during the pair phase this
            phosphorylated three carbon sugar is
            getting converted into pyruvic acid
            through various steps and during these
            phase we can see that
            uh like energy molecules atp and 88 etc
            they are being produced
            okay so it is an energy conserving uh
            phase or we can say
            during this phase energy is generated
            okay so preparatory phase of priming
            phase energy
            utilization phase or energizing phase
            while
            um the payoff phase that is the energy
            generation phase okay so this is about
            the
            two major phases of glycolysis we can
            see the phase wise
            glycolithic what all are the reactions
            going on okay
