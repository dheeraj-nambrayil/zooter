            Introduction
            hello everyone welcome back so we have
            been discussing on the
            uh initial phases of krebs cycle
            and we saw that the acetyl coenzyme
            a which is a very important substrate
            in that enter the krebs cycle uh
            it is being produced from various
            substrates including fatty acids
            different kinds of amino acids like
            ketogenic amino acids
            and the most important one among them it
            is a pyruvic acid
            the pyruvic acid it is produced as a
            product of glucose oxidation
            and it is one of the most important uh
            substrate for the production of acetyl
            coenzyme
            this pyruvate which is being produced as
            a result of glycolysis
            the glycolysis takes place in the
            cytoplasm so pyruvic acid is produced in
            the
            cytoplasm and this pyruvic acid it is
            like transported into the mitochondrial
            matrix
            ah and then it is there
            where the pyruvate is getting converted
            to acetyl coenzyme
            okay so uh the conversion of pyruvate to
            acetyl coenzyme takes place inside the
            mitochondria
            right now the conversion of the pyruvate
            into acetyl coenzyme it is an oxidative
            decarboxylation process that is
            oxidation as well as
            decarboxylation process and it consists
            of three steps
            the three steps it is being catalyzed by
            the enzyme
            pyruvate dehydrogenase complex commonly
            it is referred as
            pdh the pyruvate dehydration is complex
            it catalyzes
            three steps which occurs in sequence
            the first one the carboxylation the
            second oxidation
            and third the transfer of the
            resultant acetyl group to on to coenzyme
            a to produce
            acetyl coenzyme okay so pyruvate
            undergoes
            decarboxylation the intermediary
            substrate it undergoes
            oxidation and then it uh undergoes a
            transfer
            like it undergoes um what you call the
            transfer of
            acetyl group onto the coins and so this
            is how the whole process takes place
            okay we will uh just like look into the
            detail of each of these steps
            and this is how the final what you call
            uh the equation which shows the
            conversion that is spiral weight it
            gets convert to acetyl coenzyme right
            and for that
            along with pyruvate coenzyme is required
            and
            nad is getting utilized nad is getting
            utilized
            as a uh what you call oxidizing agent
            okay then uh the coenzyme a pyruvate it
            will
            react to produce acetyl coenzyme and
            carbon dioxide
            and nad it will get reduced to produce
            nadh
            and h plus okay so the pyruvate
            Pyruvate dehydrogenase
            dehydrogenase complex
            it contains three enzymes that is
            pyruvate dehydrogenase it is considered
            to be e1
            in the equation over here dihydrolipoy
            trans acetylease that is e2
            over here and dihydrolipoy dehydrogenase
            that is the e3
            okay so uh as a first step the pyruvic
            acid it undergoes
            decarboxylation it gets decarboxylated
            to produce
            uh here you can see
            it is the acetol tpp complex okay
            uh it undergoes decarboxylation and the
            enzyme involves pyruvate dehydrogenase
            the product reduced it is acetol
            tpp complex that is it is an activated
            acetaldehyde
            and carbon dioxide is released so you
            can see here
            so it is that is why it is known as a
            decarboxylation process okay it is
            pyruvate dehydrogenase
            now uh this particular enzyme
            pyruvate dehydrogenase it require the
            presence of magnesium ions
            as well as tpp as a
            cofactor it is thiamine pyrophosphate
            now the next step is where the acetal
            tpp complex
            it undergoes oxidation right the
            uh acetyl tpp complex it is a
            like undergoes oxidation where
            a two carbon acetyl group gets
            transferred from
            acetone tpp uh to lipoic acid
            okay so this particular reaction it
            needs a presence of
            lipoic acid or what is known as a lipo
            weight right
            ah so it is uh this particular vertical
            product that is acetyl tpp
            it gets converted to s acetyl lipoic
            acid complex
            and the lipoic
            acid which is required for the
            particular reaction to be catalyzed
            it remains bound to the
            dihydrolip oil acid transferase
            okay or transesteries dihydrolipoid
            transectinis so this is what happens
            during the
            process right now the next one
            it is actually the um
            transfer of acetyl group onto the
            coenzyme so transferred to coenzyme
            resulting in the formation of acetyl
            coenzyme
            okay so here what happens is the acetyl
            lipoic acid which is produced
            after the oxidation process uh
            from there the acetyl group is getting
            transferred
            to the coenzyme a resulting in the
            formation of acetyl coenzyme a
            and a product it is a dihydro
            lipoic acid so acetyl coenzyme a and
            dihydrolipoic acid
            are produced as a result of this
            particular reaction
            okay the ah what you call the enzyme
            involved as the the acetyl transferase
            over here
            okay now the lip uh dihydrolipoic acid
            has to be
            converted back to lipoic acid so that
            this reaction continues
            right because here the lipoic acid is
            required for the process isn't it so the
            dihydrolipic acid has to be converted
            back into
            lipoic acid and this conversion it is
            complete
            this conversion is made possible uh by
            the enzyme dihydrolip dihydrolipoid
            dehydrogenase and this requires the
            coenzyme fad so lipoic acid
            and fadh2 are produced as a result so
            dihydrolipoic acid
            it gets converted lipoic acid and ah
            during this process fad it gets reduced
            okay so this is the whole process taking
            place so in a nutshell it is like
            pyruvate it is getting converted to
            acetyl coenzyme and carbon dioxide is
            produced during the process
            and for the whole process to take place
            what is required
            pyruvate dehydrogenase complex the
            enzyme is required
            which is formed of three different
            enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase
            dihydrolipoid trans acetylene and
            dihydrolipid
            dehydrogenase okay uh here you can see
            what are the cofactors required
            it is coenzyme a for the last process
            that is
            the transfer to the coenzyme they
            require coenzyme
            okay then they require nad
            and fad where nad is getting
            reduced and then lipoic acid
            i hope you remember in the second step
            during the oxidation the lipoic acid is
            required
            right and for the first pro step they
            need the presence of magnesium ions and
            thiamine pyrophosphate so this is a
            whole process
            pyruvate it get uh it is getting
            oxidative
            decarboxylation it undergoes oxidative
            decarboxylation
            the carboxylation and oxidation okay
            to result in the formation of acetyl
            coenzyme
            and the whole process it takes place
            inside the mitochondria
            now this is the uh enzyme here
            okay uh the
            pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex
            here which is composed of three
            enzymes the e1 is responsible for
            decarboxylation of pyruvate you can see
            this is the pyruvate and carbon dioxide
            is released
            this particular product produced as a
            result it will uh
            take up oxidation during the oxidation
            process
            the nad is getting reduced and the
            product it becomes
            uh oxidized okay this oxidized product
            it will be taken for
            the next step where the acetyl group of
            the product it is getting transferred on
            to
            coenzyme a and we get the acetyl
            coenzyme
            and the dihydrolipoic acid as a
            byproduct this dihydrolipoic acid will
            be converted back into
            lipoic acid so that the reaction can be
            continued so this is what happens here
            okay the what you call the pyruvate plus
            the nad
            plus the coenzyme a it will give rise to
            uh the acetyl coenzyme
            nadh and h plus and carbon dioxide so
            this is a whole step
            okay so we have the uh pyruvate getting
            Pyruvate complex
            converted to acetyl coenzyme
            and it requires pyruvate complex
            which is a enzyme complex formed of
            three separate enzymes
            and each of these enzymes are
            responsible for decarboxylation
            oxidation and the transfer of acetyl
            group to
            coenzyme a and re-synthesis of
            the lipoic acid so all these three four
            other
            steps involved in pyruvate to acetyl
            coenzyme conversion
            okay fine then thank you
