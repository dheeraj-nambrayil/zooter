            hello everyone welcome back uh this
            presentation we will continue with the
            discussion glycogenesis
            uh in the previous presentation we
            already saw that the glucose is the
            monomeric unit which is being used for
            the synthesis of glycogen
            in the process of glycogenesis the
            glucose it gets phosphorylated
            uh it gets activated by phosphorylation
            to form glucose one phosphate
            through glucose six phosphate the
            glucose
            one phosphate uh for the conversion of
            this glucose one phosphate to glycogen
            uh
            glycogen synthase is required
            which which actually helps in um
            which employs actually the udp glucose
            as the glucoside
            donor okay so the glucose udp glucose
            is formed uh with the help of the udp
            glucose phosphorylase
            you glucose one phosphate it takes
            utilizes utp
            for the synthesis of udp glucose uh and
            this particular process it is being
            catalyzed by
            the udp glucose pyrophosphorylase
            during this process of pyrophosphate is
            being produced which later will get
            hydrolyzed to produce two um ortho
            phosphates
            and the energy trapped in the bone
            between them it is being
            uh released and that can be used for
            running up the whole reaction
            okay now the uh later what happens to
            the udp glucose
            uh the glucoside group of the udp
            glucose it is transferred
            to a an acceptor molecule
            this acceptor it could be either a
            glycogen primer
            or it could be uh the
            dolly called phosphate depending upon
            which is the acceptor whether it is a
            dollichol phosphate that receives the
            gluco
            the glucose or whether it is the
            glycogen primer that is going to receive
            the glucose
            uh the pathways are two different
            pathways can be recognized one is the
            glycogen primal pathway which utilizes
            the glycogen primer
            and which is the most important pathway
            for glycogenesis another is the
            golicol phosphate pathway which is
            mainly
            involved in the synthesis of
            oligosaccharides
            which involves like glucose mannose and
            acetyl glucosamine etc
            okay but the glycogen primer pathway it
            is mainly for the synthesis of glycogen
            through the utilization of glucosal
            receptors
            okay so here what happens is the udp
            glucose it is transferred in the
            glycogen primer pathway the udp glu
            the glucoside residue on the udp glucose
            it is transferred to the
            terminal glucose residue at the non
            reducing
            end of glycogen chain okay very small
            glycogen chain which is considered to be
            a
            glycogen primer and this will result in
            the formation of
            alpha one four glycosidic bond between
            the carb uh
            carbon one of the uh new
            uh glucosal residue and the uh
            fourth four hydroxyl here you can see
            this will be better okay so this is the
            udp glucose and this is the
            glycogen primer and here you can see
            this is the glucosyl residue of the utp
            glucose
            it will be transferred on to the
            glycogen primer
            and during this process what happens is
            a bond is formed between
            a glycosidic bond is formed between one
            prime carbon of the new sugar
            here you can see with the uh hydroxyl
            group on the
            fourth carbon of the non-reducing end of
            the glycogen gene okay this is the
            glycogen chain and this is the
            non-reducing end so what happens there
            is a bond between
            formed between the fourth carbon on of
            the
            non-reducing end of the glycogen gene
            and first carbon of the new sugar
            okay and this will result in the
            formation release of water molecule and
            formation of a new glycosidic bone
            and the new non-reducing indus formed
            okay and the whole process it is being
            catalyzed by the enzyme
            glycogen synthase and this
            this releases udp now the glycogen
            synthase it requires a primer as already
            mentioned
            uh it requires as a primer
            and one for poly glucose gene that is
            what the glycogen primer
            act does okay and this glycogen primer
            has to be
            at least four glucose residue in length
            okay and only in uh that condition it
            can act as a
            glycogen primer okay so only when the
            chain is more than four glycoside unit
            long the um glycogen synthase can
            catalyze
            the transfer of glucosyl residue from
            the udp glucose
            okay so once it it
            finds a glycogen primer with at least
            four glucoside residues
            the glucose is added on to the
            non-reducing end
            one for glycosidic bonus form and the
            chain length increases like this
            okay it will result in a increase in
            chain length now what happens is
            uh when the chain length the elongated
            glycogen chain
            it becomes almost like eight to ten you
            um
            units long another enzyme
            it comes into play uh actually this is
            just a linear chain which is
            getting produced but for the synthesis
            of glycogen what is needed a branching
            has to be developed
            and this branching is done it cannot be
            done by the glycogen synthase
            instead there is a new enzyme which
            comes into play for developing the
            uh the what you call the bone the
            branching
            and that is a branching enzyme okay it
            the branching enzyme it is otherwise
            referred as
            the milo transglycolyse or the glucan
            branching enzyme
            okay here you can see right glucosyl
            alpha
            transferase inside now what they do is
            they will
            this particular enzyme it will make a
            break for example somewhere here
            okay somewhere here we can see um so it
            will make a
            yeah it will make a break uh uh
            uh it will break a alpha one for
            glycosidic bond
            and separate a short stretch of glucosal
            residues
            and this short stretch which is
            separated it will be added on to
            some other residue in the same chain or
            in some other chain but
            here it is on the same chain okay so
            here you can see it is 1 to 16
            16 glucose residues are there and
            somewhere just
            behind ah just uh like
            after the 11th glucosal residue or 10th
            glucose residue a break has been made
            alpha one for glycosidic bond is broken
            okay and uh uh
            like the 11 to 16
            right these uh uh stretch short stretch
            of glucose residues
            is separated from the linear chain and
            it is being added on to the
            seventh sugar over here okay it needn't
            be always the same
            but uh here it is added on to the
            seventh one and a new bond is formed it
            is a alpha one six bond
            okay so uh the in the branching enzyme
            it will break the alpha one for
            glycosidic mode
            separates a short stretch of fragment of
            glucose residues from the linear chain
            and then it reattaches to the
            chain through a alpha one sixth
            glycosidic bone
            so this creates a branching point over
            here this is a branching point now what
            happens is there are two non-reducing
            ends here
            one on this side and one on this side on
            this end right
            now the glycogen synthase it can add
            glucosal residues to both the
            ends right and then whenever
            a branching has to be made a new
            branching is done with the help of this
            glycogen branching enzyme and there
            a new branch will be produced a new uh
            bran what you call
            the non-reducing end will be made and
            the glycogen synthase can
            continue with its work so it is actually
            uh
            glycogen synthase and like a branching
            enzyme
            they will continue and they alternate
            their actions
            uh resulting in the formation of a
            highly branched
            glycogen molecule a glycogen polymer
            okay and so branching it makes the
            glycogen molecule soluble
            and more globular and it creates more
            non-reducing ends for the action of the
            phosphorylase enzyme okay so this is
            what happens so this is the
            glycogen primer pathway where udp
            glucose uh
            transfers glycosal residue onto the non
            reducing end of the glycogen chain
            and here you can see the branching
            enzyme how it works it breaks a
            1 4 glycosidic moon breaks it and then
            add attaches it to some other
            to a glycosal residue on the chain uh
            by way of alpha 1 6 glycosidic bond
            which creates a branching point
            and a new non-reducing end okay so this
            is what happens now we can see the dolly
            called phosphate pathway
            uh in the case of tolic or phosphate
            pathway the dolly calls
            they are long chain unsaturated
            isopronoid alcohols okay
            so it is phosphorylated dolly call and
            here you can see
            this one is a isopronoid you can see
            almost eight
            16 to 21 isopronoids units may be there
            in a dolly call
            that is almost 84 carbon atoms long and
            they are usually found free or in
            phosphorylated dollars are found
            free or in phosphorylated forms in the
            membranes of endoplasmic reticulum as
            well as in golgi bodies
            and the phosphorylated oligol it gets
            glycosylated
            at this particular point with the help
            of nucleoside diphosphate
            sugars okay that is for example gdp
            sugars right
            so uh gdp sugar or gdp gtp is required
            for
            transferring the sugar onto this one
            right
            any nucleoside diphosphate for example
            it is in this one it is gdp
            sugar okay so sugar residue is
            transferred to the end of the growing
            chain
            of the non-liquid so glucosyl units it
            is trans
            are transferred from udp glucose to an
            intermediate acceptor
            that is a glu a dolly called phos
            phosphate and uh the dolichol phosphate
            bound oligosaccharide
            is formed and this oligosaccharide it is
            then transferred
            onto a protein molecule with the help of
            a glycogen synthetase
            okay and this forms a protein bound
            oligosaccharide
            right so it is a what you call a protein
            plus the
            oligosaccharide right okay
