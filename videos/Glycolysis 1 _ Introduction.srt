00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
hello everyone welcome to a new session

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,919
in biochemistry

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,520
this presentation brings to you the

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,040
detailed account

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,639
of the metabolic process glycolysis

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,559
the glycolysis the term comes from two

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,000
greek terms

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,279
the greek root words which means sugar

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,800
or splitting okay sugar and splitting

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,600
which means glycolysis in nutshell it is

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,480
the

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,480
breakdown or the splitting or the

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,840
dissolution of

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,480
the sugar molecule it could be glucose

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,920
mainly it is glucose

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,800
okay so that is glycolysis so it can be

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,079
defined as

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,040
sequence of reactions that metabolizes

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,719
one molecule of glucose

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,200
to produce two molecules of spiderweight

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,360
along with production of atp

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,840
so uh the glucose molecule a single

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,879
glucose molecule

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,039
it is broken down to produce two

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,199
molecules of pyruvic acid

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,920
and along with that energy is produced

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,559
in the form of

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,199
atp molecules okay what are the

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,359
significant features of

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,359
what you call glycolysis you can say

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,438
that glycolysis

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,200
it occurs in all the cells of the body

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,799
and enzymes of enzymes required for the

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,000
glycolytic pathway

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,320
it is present in the cytoplasm of all

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,200
the cells

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
okay and it is considered to be the sole

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,119
source of

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,920
what you call energy in many of the

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,840
mammalian tissues and cell types for

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,119
example

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,640
glycolysis it is a major pathway for the

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,159
synthesis of energy for the

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,439
atp synthesis in tissues which lack

45
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,320
mitochondria

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,079
for example erythrocytes then

47
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,439
what you call cornea lens etc and other

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,159
than that

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,040
it is also the souls of souls of energy

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,680
in many

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,720
um tissues like renal medulla

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,000
of that of a brain sperm etc so

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,320
glycolysis is very essential for brain

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
which is depend upon uh glucose for

55
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,600
energy

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,920
and uh the as already mentioned the

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,159
glucose is the sole source of energy

58
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,719
in the brain and uh the like it depends

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,639
upon glycolysis for the complete

60
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,360
uh energy purpose and along with that

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,520
many anaerobic microorganisms they are

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,040
entirely dependent on

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
a glucose because glycolysis is a

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,480
anaerobic process

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,520
it doesn't require oxygen so it can

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,879
take place in the absence or

67
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,080
in the presence of oxygen

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,879
in the presence of oxygen that is in

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,040
aerobic condition what happens is

70
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,680
the glucose it breaks down to pyruvate

71
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,360
and this pyruvate later

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,560
it can ah get oxidized to carbon dioxide

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,200
and water

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,879
but in the absence of oxygen the um

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,640
like the glucose it will break down to

76
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,480
pyruvate which will enter the anaerobic

77
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,280
pathway

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,640
and result in the production of lactate

79
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,120
uh under anaerobic condition okay so

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,239
whichever will be the way

81
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,440
it we can see that uh it does it occurs

82
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,879
in the absence as well as in the

83
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,000
presence of oxygen

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,920
okay so that is more important thing

85
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,840
because there are plenty of organisms

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,239
which

87
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,040
come completely depend on the glycolytic

88
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,640
pathway for their energy

89
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,200
uh needs okay it is because glycolysis

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,000
can very well

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,840
uh get completed in the absence of

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
oxygen

93
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,440
now uh we can see that uh the

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,200
the glycolytic pathway it was

95
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959
illustrated uh

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,360
or the complete uh pathway of glycolysis

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
was elucidated by 1940

98
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,440
and um endon and miroff they were two by

99
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,000
chemists

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,360
who had contributed uh to the knowledge

101
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,840
of

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,280
glycolysis um especially the enzymatic

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,599
uh breakdown at various stages of

104
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,360
glycolysis we completely studied

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,720
and elucidated by emden and meirav and

106
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,840
in honor of these two uh vacuums

107
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,799
the glycolysis is also known as emden

108
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,080
mayor of pathway

109
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,959
okay so the this is about the glycolysis

110
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,280
the interaction okay that is glycolysis

111
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,360
it involves sequence of reactions that

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,400
will convert

113
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,720
or break down glucose into two molecules

114
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,519
a single

115
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,280
molecule of glucose into two molecules

116
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,439
of uh pyruvic acid along with the

117
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,720
production of atp

118
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,880
okay and there are uh glycolysis is uh

119
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,519
unique because it can happen in both uh

120
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,600
presence or absence of oxygen

121
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,280
in the presence of oxygen the glucose

122
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,720
molecule it will be

123
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,240
broken down into two molecules of

124
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
pyruvate pyruvic acid

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
and uh under the in the absence of

126
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,120
oxygen this

127
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,199
pyruvic acid it can get converted into

128
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,160
lactic acid

129
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,360
okay uh in the uh um

130
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,840
or even what you call uh alcoholic

131
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,600
fermentation is that uh in

132
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,840
east and uh so uh in the presence of

133
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,160
oxygen what happens the pyruvate it is

134
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,560
getting oxidized to form carbon dioxide

135
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,280
water

136
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
right so it can happen in both

137
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,880
situations that are so

138
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,759
many cells which can which are

139
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,919
anaerobically functioning they do depend

140
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,199
on glycolysis for their

141
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,600
energy date secondly we can see that

142
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,039
there are many cells which

143
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,000
uh lack mitochondria they are they may

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
be aerobic but they lack mitochondria

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,880
so they have to depend upon glycolysis

146
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,440
for their

147
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,160
complete source of energy okay so that

148
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
is about the glycolysis

149
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,120
now regarding the um steps involved

150
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,919
glycolysis the whole complete sequence

151
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,280
of reactions it can be

152
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,880
divided into two phases that is

153
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
preparatory phase or the priming phase

154
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,840
we call

155
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,960
uh and the payoff phase okay the first

156
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,080
phase is a preparatory phase

157
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,960
and uh the first set of phases and the

158
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,479
preparatory phase or the first phase of

159
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,759
glycolysis

160
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,720
it is referred as priming phase or it is

161
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,639
known as energizing phase

162
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,320
okay priming phase in the sense the

163
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,360
phase where the energy is being utilized

164
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,960
okay energy is being utilized in the

165
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,639
form of atp right

166
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,639
and during this particular phase we can

167
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,479
see that the glucose

168
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,520
it gets uh phosphorylated uh

169
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,560
and then it splits into two uh

170
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,280
the triose phosphate molecules okay so

171
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,160
it is actually

172
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,880
uh glucose produ uh converted into

173
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,639
glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate

174
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,680
and this process it gets

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,960
included under preparatory phase and uh

176
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,120
the glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate is a

177
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,080
three carbon

178
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,840
containing compound or three carbon

179
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,160
containing sugar while glucose is a six

180
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,520
carbon containing sugar

181
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,319
so a six carbon sugar is uh converted

182
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:28,960
into

183
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,000
three carbon phosphorylated sugar okay

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
this is what happens in the preparatory

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,000
phase

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,840
and here you can see a

187
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,520
non-phosphorylated sugar is getting

188
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,199
converted into phosphorylated sugar

189
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,039
obviously there is a requirement of

190
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,680
atp okay so that is where the atp is

191
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,560
getting you

192
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,080
utilized and energy is uh like used

193
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,880
okay so it is actually glucose is

194
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
getting activated

195
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,960
or it is getting primed we call or it is

196
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,400
getting prepared for the

197
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,759
glycolytic process okay the second phase

198
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,880
uh actually it is known as the

199
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,039
payoff phase or we call it as uh energy

200
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,479
uh what you call um it

201
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,280
is actually atp is produced during this

202
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,680
phase okay it is energy conserving phase

203
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
okay or conservation phase okay

204
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,000
so here what happens is the free energy

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,599
which is trapped in the substrate

206
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,560
molecules

207
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,680
uh it is the free energy it is getting

208
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,280
trapped in the substrate molecules and

209
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,919
this

210
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,000
is getting con conserved in the form of

211
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,280
atp okay

212
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,440
here the glyceraldehyde three phosphate

213
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
it is getting converted into

214
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,160
the pyruvic acid okay ultimately passing

215
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,280
through various tips

216
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,680
pyruvic acid is produced and during the

217
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,039
this particular phase

218
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,080
nadh in atp molecules are produced

219
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,560
uh which is actually energy conserving

220
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,280
molecules

221
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,080
okay so glycolysis it is for um the

222
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
whole set of reactions it can be

223
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,599
uh differentiated into two phases

224
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,960
preparatory phase and p

225
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
of phase preparatory phase is otherwise

226
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,039
known as priming phase or energy

227
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,720
spending phase okay it is actually

228
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,479
energy requiring phase

229
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,440
here what happens is the glucose uh

230
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
molecule is getting prepared

231
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,400
or activated to undergo the glycolytic

232
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,199
pathway

233
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,680
okay and in the preparatory phase

234
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,520
glucose which is a six carbon sugar is

235
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,120
getting converted into

236
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,879
phosphorylated three carbon sugar which

237
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,960
is this glyceraldehyde three phosphate

238
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,879
okay during the pair phase this

239
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,639
phosphorylated three carbon sugar is

240
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,639
getting converted into pyruvic acid

241
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,800
through various steps and during these

242
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
phase we can see that

243
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,279
uh like energy molecules atp and 88 etc

244
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,559
they are being produced

245
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,120
okay so it is an energy conserving uh

246
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,640
phase or we can say

247
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,839
during this phase energy is generated

248
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,519
okay so preparatory phase of priming

249
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,880
phase energy

250
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,279
utilization phase or energizing phase

251
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,080
while

252
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,920
um the payoff phase that is the energy

253
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,080
generation phase okay so this is about

254
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
the

255
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,399
two major phases of glycolysis we can

256
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,680
see the phase wise

257
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,240
glycolithic what all are the reactions

258
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,839
going on okay
